<h3><i>THE POLITICAL HISTORY OF ENGLAND</i></h3>


<p><i>Seventy-five years have passed since Lingard completed his</i> <span class="smcap">History of
England</span>, <i>which ends with the Revolution of 1688. During that period
historical study has made a great advance. Year after year the mass of
materials for a new History of England has increased; new lights have been
thrown on events and characters, and old errors have been corrected. Many
notable works have been written on various periods of our history; some of
them at such length as to appeal almost exclusively to professed
historical students. It is believed that the time has come when the
advance which has been made in the knowledge of English history as a whole
should be laid before the public in a single work of fairly adequate size.
Such a book should be founded on independent thought and research, but
should at the same time be written with a full knowledge of the works of
the best modern historians and with a desire to take advantage of their
teaching wherever it appears sound.</i></p>

<p><i>The vast number of authorities, printed and in manuscript, on which a
History of England should be based, if it is to represent the existing
state of knowledge, renders co-operation almost necessary and certainly
advisable. The History, of which this volume is an instalment, is an
attempt to set forth in a readable form the results at present attained by
research. It will consist of twelve volumes by twelve different writers,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ii" id="Page_ii">[Pg ii]</a></span>each of them chosen as being specially capable of dealing with the period
which he undertakes, and the editors, while leaving to each author as free
a hand as possible, hope to insure a general similarity in method of
treatment, so that the twelve volumes may in their contents, as well as in
their outward appearance, form one History.</i></p>

<p><i>As its title imports, this History will primarily deal with politics,
with the History of England and, after the date of the union with
Scotland, Great Britain, as a state or body politic; but as the life of a
nation is complex, and its condition at any given time cannot be
understood without taking into account the various forces acting upon it,
notices of religious matters and of intellectual, social, and economic
progress will also find place in these volumes. The footnotes will, so far
as is possible, be confined to references to authorities, and references
will not be appended to statements which appear to be matters of common
knowledge and do not call for support. Each volume will have an Appendix
giving some account of the chief authorities, original and secondary,
which the author has used. This account will be compiled with a view of
helping students rather than of making long lists of books without any
notes as to their contents or value. That the History will have faults
both of its own and such as will always in some measure attend
co-operative work, must be expected, but no pains have been spared to make
it, so far as may be, not wholly unworthy of the greatness of its
subject.</i></p>

<p><i>Each volume, while forming part of a complete History, will also in
itself be a separate and complete book, will be sold separately, and will
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_iii" id="Page_iii">[Pg iii]</a></span>have its own index, and two or more maps.</i></p>

<p><i>When the late Warden of Merton undertook the preparation of this volume
he invited the assistance of Dr. Fotheringham in the portions dealing with
foreign affairs. At the time of the late Warden's death in 1903 three
chapters (x., xii. and xviii.) were unwritten, and one (xx.) was left
incomplete. It was also found that the volume had to be recast in order to
meet the plan of the series. The necessary alterations and additions have
been made by Dr. Fotheringham, who has been scrupulous in retaining the
expression of the late Warden's views, and, where possible, his words.</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span></p>

<h3>ADDINGTON.</h3>


<p><a name="TOPIC_1" id="TOPIC_1"></a>When, early in March, 1801, Pitt resigned office, he was succeeded by
Henry Addington, who had been speaker of the house of commons for over
eleven years, and who now received the seals of office as first lord of
the treasury and chancellor of the exchequer on March 14, 1801. He was
able to retain the services of the Duke of Portland as home secretary, of
Lord Chatham as president of the council, and of Lord Westmorland as lord
privy seal. For the rest, his colleagues were, like himself, new to
cabinet rank. Lord Hawkesbury (afterwards the second Earl of Liverpool)
became foreign secretary, and Lord Hobart, son of the Earl of
Buckinghamshire, secretary for war. Loughborough reaped the due reward of
his treachery by being excluded from the ministry altogether; with a
curious obstinacy he persisted in attending cabinet councils, until a
letter from Addington informed him that his presence was not desired. He
received some small consolation, however, in his elevation to the Earldom
of Rosslyn. Lord Eldon was the new chancellor and was destined to hold the
office uninterruptedly, except for the brief ministry of Fox and
Grenville, till 1827. Lord St. Vincent became first lord of the admiralty,
and Lord Lewisham president of the board of control. Cornwallis had
resigned with Pitt, but it was not till June 16 that a successor was found
for him as master general of the ordnance. It was then arranged that
Chatham should take this office. Portland succeeded Chatham as lord
president, and Lord Pelham, whose father had just been created Earl of
Chichester, became home secretary instead of Portland. An important change
was introduced into the distribution of work between the different
secretaries of state, the administration of colonial affairs being
transferred from the home to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span> war office, so that Hobart and his
successors down to 1854 were known as secretaries of state for war and the
colonies. Soon afterwards Lewisham succeeded his father as Earl of
Dartmouth.</p>

<p>Though the Addington ministry has, not without justice, been derided for
its weakness as compared with its immediate predecessor, it is interesting
to observe that in it one of the greatest of English judges as well as a
future premier, destined to display an unique power of holding his party
together, first attained to cabinet rank; and in the following year it was
reinforced by Castlereagh, who disputes with Canning the honour of being
regarded as the ablest statesman of what was then the younger generation.
The weakness of the ministry must therefore be attributed to a lack of
experience rather than a lack of talent. It was unfortunate in succeeding
a particularly strong administration, but is well able to bear comparison
with most of the later ministries of George III. Addington himself was in
more thorough sympathy with the king than any premier before or after.
Conversation with Addington was, according to the king, like "thinking
aloud"; and with a king who, like George III., still regarded himself as
responsible for the national policy, hearty co-operation between king and
premier was a matter of no slight importance.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_2" id="TOPIC_2"></a>In the early days of the new administration Pitt loyally kept his promise
of friendly support, and it is to be deplored that Grenville and Canning
did not adopt the same course. While the issue of peace and war was
pending, domestic legislation inevitably remained in abeyance. In Ireland
serious disappointment had been caused by the abandonment of catholic
emancipation; but the disappointment was borne quietly, and the Irish
Roman catholics doubtless did not foresee to what a distance of time the
removal of their disabilities had been postponed. The just and mild rule
of the new lord lieutenant, Lord Hardwicke, contributed to the
pacification of the country. But in reality the conduct of the movement
for emancipation was only passing into new hands; when it reappeared it
was no longer led by catholic lords and bishops, but was a peasant
movement, headed by the unscrupulous demagogue O'Connell. In these
circumstances it is to be regretted that the new administration neglected
to carry that one of the half-promised<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span> concessions to the catholics which
could not offend the king's conscience, namely, the commutation of tithe.
Nothing in the protestant ascendency was so irritating to the catholic
peasantry as the necessity of paying tithe to a protestant clergy, and its
commutation, while benefiting the clergy themselves, would have removed
the occasion of subsequent agitation. The spirit of disloyalty, however,
was believed to be by no means extinct either in Ireland or in Great
Britain, and two stringent acts were passed to repress it. The first, for
the continuance of martial law in Ireland, was supported by almost all the
Irish speakers in the house of commons, where it was carried without a
division, and was adopted in the house of lords by an overwhelming
majority, after an impressive speech from Lord Clare. The second, for the
suspension of the <i>habeas corpus</i> act in the whole United Kingdom was
framed to remain in force "during the continuance of the war, and for one
month after the signing of a definitive treaty of peace".</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE HORNE TOOKE ACT.</i></div>

<p>The only other measure of permanent interest which became law in this
session was the so-called "Horne Tooke act," occasioned by the return of
Horne Tooke, who was in holy orders, for Old Sarum. Such a return was
contrary to custom, but the precedents collected by a committee of the
house of commons were inconclusive. It was accordingly enacted that in
future clergymen of the established churches should be ineligible for
seats in parliament, while Horne Tooke was deemed to have been validly
elected, and retained his seat. The house of commons found time, however,
for an important and well-sustained debate on India, in which among others
Dundas, now no longer in office, showed a thorough knowledge of questions
affecting Indian finance and trade.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_3" id="TOPIC_3"></a>The naval expedition which had been prepared in the last days of Pitt's
administration sailed for Copenhagen on March 12, 1801, under Sir Hyde
Parker, with Nelson as second in command. The admiral in chief was of a
cautious temper, but was wise enough to allow himself to be guided by
Nelson's judgment when planning an engagement, though not as to the
general course of the expedition. The fleet consisted of sixteen ships of
the line and thirty-four smaller vessels; all these with the exception of
one ship of the line reached the Skaw on the 18th. A frigate was sent in
advance with instructions to Vansittart,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span> the British envoy at Copenhagen,
to present an ultimatum to the Danish government,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> demanding a
favourable answer to the British demands within forty-eight hours. For
three days Parker waited at anchor eighteen miles from Elsinore, and it
was only when Vansittart brought an unfavourable reply on the 23rd that he
took Nelson into his counsels. He readily adopted Nelson's plan of
ignoring the Danish batteries at Kronborg and making a circuit so as to
attack Copenhagen at the weak southern end of its defences, but set aside
his project of masking Copenhagen and making straight for a Russian
squadron of twelve ships of the line which was lying icebound at Revel.
The fair weather of the 26th was wasted in irresolution, and it was not
till the 30th that the fleet was able to weigh anchor. It passed Kronborg
in safety and anchored five miles north of Copenhagen.</p>

<p>Parker placed under Nelson's immediate command twelve ships of the line
and twenty-one smaller vessels, by far the greater part of the British
fleet. With these he was to pass to the east of a shoal called the Middle
Ground and attack the defences of Copenhagen from the south, while Parker
with the remainder of the fleet was to make a demonstration against the
more formidable northern defences. The wind could not of course favour
both attacks simultaneously, and it was agreed that the attack should be
made when the wind favoured Nelson. The nights of the 30th and 31st were
spent in reconnoitring and laying buoys. On April 1 a north wind brought
Nelson's squadron past the Middle Ground, and on the next day a south wind
enabled him to attack the Danish fleet, if fleet it may be called. At the
north end of the Danish position stood the only permanent battery, the
Trekroner, with two hulks or blockships; the rest consisted of seven
blockships and eleven floating batteries, drawn up along the shore. An
attack on the south end of the line was also exposed to batteries on the
island of Amager. Nelson's intention was to close with the whole Danish
fleet, but three of his ships of the line were stranded and he was obliged
to leave the assault on the northern end entirely to lighter vessels.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>BATTLE OF THE BALTIC.</i></div>

<p>The Danish batteries proved more powerful than had been anticipated, and
as time went on and the Danish resistance did not appear to lose in
strength, Parker grew doubtful of the result of the battle and gave the
order to cease action. The order was apparently not intended to be
imperative, but it had the effect of inducing Riou, who commanded the
frigate squadron, to sail away to the north. For the rest of the fleet
obedience was out of the question. Nelson acknowledged, but refused to
repeat the order, and, jocularly placing his glass to his blind eye,
declared that he could not see the signal. At length the British cannonade
told. Fischer, the Danish commander, had had to shift his flag twice, at
the second time to the Trekroner, and all the ships south of that battery
had either ceased fire or were practically helpless. The Trekroner,
however, was still unsubdued and rendered it impossible for Nelson's
squadron to retire, in the only direction which the wind would allow,
without severe loss. He accordingly sent a message to the Danish Prince
Regent, declaring that he would be compelled to burn the batteries he had
taken, without saving their crews, unless firing ceased. If a truce were
arranged until he could take his prisoners out of the prizes, he was
prepared to land the wounded Danes, and burn or remove the prizes. A truce
for twenty-four hours was accordingly arranged, which Nelson employed to
remove his own fleet unmolested.</p>

<p>The destruction of the southern batteries left Copenhagen exposed to
bombardment, and the Danes, unable to resist, yet afraid to offend the
tsar by submission, prolonged the time from day to day till news arrived
which removed all occasion for hostility. Unknown to either of the
combatants, the Tsar Paul, the life and soul of the northern confederacy,
had been murdered on the night of March 23, ten days before the battle,
and with his death the league was practically dissolved. When Nelson
advanced further into the Baltic, he found no hostile fleet awaiting him,
and the new tsar, Alexander, adopting an opposite policy, entered into a
compromise on the subject of maritime rights. The battle of the Baltic is
considered by some to have been Nelson's masterpiece. It won for him the
title of viscount and for his second in command, Rear-Admiral Graves, the
gift of the ribbon of the Bath, but the admiralty,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span> for official reasons,
declined to confer any public reward or honour on the officers concerned
in it</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_4" id="TOPIC_4"></a>At the same time, the French occupation of Egypt was drawing towards its
inevitable close. Kl&eacute;ber, who was left in command by Bonaparte, perished
by the hand of an assassin, and Menou, who succeeded to the command, was
not only a weak general, but was prevented from receiving any
reinforcements by the naval supremacy of Great Britain in the
Mediterranean. On March 21, 1801, the French army was defeated at the
battle of Alexandria by the British force sent out under Sir Ralph
Abercromby, who was himself mortally wounded on the field. His successor,
General Hutchinson, completed his work by taking Cairo, before the arrival
of General Baird, who had led a mixed body of British soldiers and sepoys
from the Red Sea across the desert to the Nile. The capitulation of
Alexandria soon followed. In September the French evacuated Egypt, the
remains of their army were conveyed to France in English ships, and
Bonaparte's long-cherished dreams of eastern conquest faded away for
ever&mdash;not from his own imagination, but from the calculations of practical
statesmanship.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_5" id="TOPIC_5"></a>French arms, and French diplomacy supported by armed force, were more
successful elsewhere. The treaty of Lun&eacute;ville was only the first of a
series of treaties, by which France secured to herself a political
position commensurate with her military glory. By the treaty of Aranjuez
between France and Spain, signed on March 21, Spain ceded Louisiana to
France, reserving the right of pre-emption, and undertook to wage war on
Portugal in order to detach it from the British alliance. Spain and
Portugal were both lukewarm in this war, and on June 6 signed the treaty
of Badajoz, by which Portugal agreed to close her ports to England, to pay
an indemnity to Spain, and to cede the small district of Olivenza, south
of Badajoz. Bonaparte was intensely irritated by this treaty, which
deprived him of the hope of exchanging conquests in Portugal for British
colonial conquests in any future negotiations; he declared that Spain
would have to pay by the sacrifice of her colonies for the conquered
French colonies which he still hoped to recover. A French army was
despatched to Portugal and enabled Bonaparte to dictate the treaty of
Madrid, signed on September 29, whereby Portugal ceded half Guiana to
France and undertook, as at Badajoz, to close her ports against England.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>INFLUENCES MAKING FOR PEACE.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_6" id="TOPIC_6"></a>This last condition was equally imposed on the King of the Two Sicilies by
the treaty of Florence, concluded on March 28, and before the end of the
year France had established friendly relations with the Sultan of Turkey
and the new Tsar of Russia. More important still, as consolidating
Bonaparte's power at home, was the concordat signed by him and the pope on
July 15 recognising Roman Catholicism as the religion of the majority of
Frenchmen, and of the consuls, guaranteeing stipends, though on an
abjectly mean scale, to the clergy, and placing the entire patronage of
the French Church in the hands of the first consul. Never since the French
revolution had the Church been thus acknowledged as the auxiliary, or
rather as the handmaid, of the state, and probably no one but the first
consul could have brought about the reconciliation. After such exertions,
even he may have sincerely desired an honourable peace, as the crown of
his victories, or at least as a breathing time, to enable him to mature
his vast designs for reorganising France. Perhaps he did not yet fully
recognise that war was a necessity of his political ascendency, no less
than of his own personal character. The French people still clung to
republican institutions; and the consulate was a nominal republic, with
all effective power vested in the first consul. Time was to show how
largely this unique position depended on his unique capacity of conducting
wars glorious to French arms; for the present, France was satisfied, and
longed for peace.</p>

<p>The English ministry, too, was impelled by strong motives to enter upon
the negotiations which resulted in the peace of Amiens. Not only was Great
Britain crippled by the loss of nearly all her allies, but the high price
of bread had roused grave disaffection,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and intensified among British
merchants a desire for an unmolested extension of commerce; above all,
English statesmen now recognised the consulate, under Bonaparte, as the
first stable and non-revolutionary government since the fall of the French
monarchy. Both countries, therefore,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span> were predisposed to entertain
pacific overtures, but the very fact that these were in contemplation
stirred both sides to further endeavours in order to secure better terms
of peace. A French squadron, commanded by Admiral Linois and containing
three ships of the line besides smaller boats, was making a movement for
the Straits of Gibraltar in order to strengthen the force at Cadiz. Sir
James Saumarez with five ships of the line and two smaller vessels engaged
Linois off Algeciras on July 5, but the French ships were supported by the
land batteries, and one of the British ships, the <i>Hannibal</i> (74), ran
aground, and Saumarez was eventually compelled to leave her in the hands
of the enemy. This victory was hailed with delight throughout France, but
it was fully retrieved a week later. The French squadron had in the
meantime been reinforced by one French and five Spanish ships of the line,
and on the 12th it made a fresh attempt to reach Cadiz; it was, however,
engaged in the Straits by Saumarez with five ships of the line. In the
ensuing battle two Spanish ships blew up, and the French <i>Saint Antoine</i>
was captured. The remainder succeeded in reaching Cadiz, but Saumarez was
able to resume the blockade a few weeks later.</p>

<p>Meanwhile there was no relaxation of French preparations for an invasion
of England, or of naval activity on the part of Great Britain. No sooner
had Nelson returned from the Baltic than he was, on July 24, placed in
command of a "squadron on a particular service," charged with the defence
of the coast from Beachy Head to Orfordness. With this he not only
blockaded the northern French ports, but assumed the aggressive, and
bombarded the vessels therein collected. A more daring attempt to cut out
the flotilla moored at Boulogne by a boat attack was repelled with some
loss on the night of August 15. But couriers under flags of truce were
already passing between London and Paris, and hostilities ceased in the
autumn of the year 1801.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE QUESTION OF MALTA.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_7" id="TOPIC_7"></a>The history of the negotiations which ended in the peace of Amiens derives
a special interest from the events which followed it. The earliest
overtures for peace were made by Hawkesbury on March 21, 1801. At first
Bonaparte refused to listen to them, but the destruction of the northern
confederacy inclined him to more pacific counsels. On April 14 the
British<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span> government stated its demands. They mark a distinct advance on
those which had been made in vain at Lille in 1797. France was to evacuate
Egypt, and Great Britain Minorca, but Great Britain claimed to retain
Malta, Tobago, Martinique, Trinidad, Essequibo, Demerara, Berbice, and
Ceylon. She was willing to surrender the Cape of Good Hope on condition
that it became a free port, and stipulated that an indemnity should be
provided for the Prince of Orange. At the outset, Bonaparte opposed all
cessions by France and her allies, but the steady improvement in the
fortunes of England in the north and in Egypt at last determined him to
grant some of the British demands, and as the evacuation of Egypt became
inevitable, he was resolved to gain something in exchange for it before it
was too late. The preliminary treaty was accordingly signed by Bonaparte's
agent Otto on behalf of France and Hawkesbury on behalf of Great Britain
on October 1, the day before the news of the French capitulation in Egypt
reached England. Great Britain had already consented to relinquish Malta,
provided that it became independent. She now consented to relinquish all
her conquests from France, and with the exception of Ceylon and Trinidad
all her conquests from the French allies, requiring, however, that the
Cape should be recognised as a free port. The French were to evacuate not
only Egypt, but the Neapolitan and Roman States. Malta was to be restored
to the knights of St. John under the guarantee of a third power. Prisoners
of war were to be released on payment of their debts, and the question of
the charge for their maintenance was to be settled by the definitive
treaty in accordance with the law of nations and established usage.</p>

<p>No mention was made of the Prince of Orange, but Otto gave a verbal
assurance that provision would be made to satisfy his claims. He also gave
the British government to understand that France would be willing to cede
Tobago in consideration of the expenses incurred in the maintenance of
French and Dutch prisoners. The omission of all reference to the
continental relations of France is conspicuous. In France it was
interpreted as indicating that Great Britain renounced her interest in
continental politics. The Batavian, Helvetian, Cisalpine, and Ligurian
republics, the kingdom of Etruria, and the whole east bank of the Rhine
were, however, supposed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span> to be already protected against French
encroachment by the treaty of Lun&eacute;ville, and Great Britain had no wish to
impose terms involving a recognition of these new creations. Again, no
mention was made of commercial relations apart from the Newfoundland and
St. Lawrence fisheries, for Great Britain was too ready to believe that a
separate commercial treaty would be practicable, and was naturally loth to
delay the conclusion of peace by a difficult negotiation.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CORNWALLIS AT AMIENS.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_8" id="TOPIC_8"></a>Cornwallis was appointed to negotiate the definitive treaty, and had some
hope that he might arrive at an informal understanding with Bonaparte at
Paris before he proceeded to Amiens. But he was offended by Bonaparte's
manner, and, dreading to be pitted against so subtle a diplomatist as
Talleyrand, he left Paris before anything was accomplished, and arrived at
Amiens on November 30. There France was represented by Joseph Bonaparte,
the first consul's elder brother, and the negotiator of Lun&eacute;ville. At
Amiens, the position of the British government was compromised from the
first by its renewed insistence on a point which had been omitted from the
preliminary treaty, namely, the compensation of the Prince of Orange. This
demand was accompanied by an endeavour to obtain compensation for the King
of Sardinia. Joseph Bonaparte, on the other hand, entrenched himself
behind the letter of the treaty, and acknowledged no further obligation.
Any additional concession to Great Britain could only be purchased by
British concessions to France. Other difficulties arose over the question
of Malta, the payment for the maintenance of prisoners, and the inclusion
of allies as parties to the treaty.</p>

<p>On the first of these questions the French would appear to have aimed
throughout at reducing the knights to as impotent a position as possible.
The British, on the other hand, ostensibly desiring to see the strength of
the order maintained, were chiefly interested in securing its neutrality.
At the time of the signature of the preliminary treaty, Russia was the
power that seemed to Great Britain the fittest guarantor of the
independence of the knights. On the refusal of Russia to accept this
position, Naples appeared to be the next best alternative, but it was
eventually agreed to substitute for the guarantee of a third power the
obviously futile guarantee of all the powers. Neither party foresaw that
the impossibility of obtaining such a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span> guarantee was destined to leave the
whole clause about Malta inoperative. After much dispute over the future
constitution of the order, France proposed to obviate the chief source of
difficulty by the demolition of the forts. This plan commended itself to
Cornwallis, but was rejected by the British government. By the end of
December it was agreed that a Neapolitan garrison was to occupy the
islands provisionally, until the new organisation should be established.
Great Britain proposed that this garrison should be maintained at the
joint expense of Great Britain and France. It did not occur to the British
government to propose any guarantee for the preservation of the property
of the order, and this omission ultimately proved material. The question
of including allies in the treaty was less complicated. France preferred a
number of separate treaties so as to keep the British interest in Europe
at a minimum. Great Britain, on the other hand, wished to make France a
party to the cessions made by her allies, and successfully insisted on the
negotiation of a single comprehensive treaty. Joseph Bonaparte granted
this point on December 11, but, as he had not full powers to negotiate
with any power except Great Britain, he continued to interpose delays till
the end of the year.</p>

<p>In the meantime France had failed in her attempts to meet the British
claims on behalf of the Prince of Orange by demands for further privileges
and territory in the oceans and colonies. On the whole, the first month's
negotiations had contributed much to a settlement, without giving a
decided advantage to either side. The lapse of time, however, turned the
balance in favour of the negotiator who was the more independent of his
country's desire for peace. On January 1, 1802, Hawkesbury wrote to
Cornwallis, treating the acquisition of Tobago as unimportant; on the 2nd
Addington expressed his readiness to accept a separate arrangement with
the Batavian republic for the Prince of Orange. By the 16th Hawkesbury had
yielded the claim of Portugal to be a party to the treaty. The refusal of
the French to cede Tobago in lieu of payment for the French prisoners, and
the difficulty of assessing the payment, opened a way to the evasion of
compensation altogether. Cornwallis, preferring to sacrifice this claim
rather than re-open the war, suggested to Joseph Bonaparte on the 22nd
that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span> treaty should provide for commissioners to assess the payment,
while it should be secretly provided that they should not be appointed. On
the same day, Joseph Bonaparte communicated his brother's consent to a
clause engaging France to find a suitable territorial possession in
Germany for the Prince of Orange.</p>

<p>If Hawkesbury and Cornwallis imagined that they had made sure of an early
peace by these extensive concessions, they were greatly mistaken.
Napoleon, flushed with this unexpected success, was encouraged to make
further trial of the pliability of the British diplomatists. Two events
occurred at this stage of the negotiations which tried the temper of both
sides to the uttermost. On January 26, Bonaparte was elected president of
the Cisalpine republic, to be styled henceforth the Italian republic. This
event seems to have taken the British government by surprise; they thought
it a distinct indication that he still contemplated further aggressions in
spite of the series of treaties by which he appeared to be securing peace,
and were therefore much less inclined than formerly to make concessions.
About the same time Bonaparte was not unreasonably enraged at the
outrageous attacks made on him in the press conducted in London by French
exiles, especially by Jean Peltier, the editor of a paper called
<i>L'Ambigu</i>, and he blamed the British government for permitting their
publication. He therefore instructed his brother Joseph to raise further
difficulties over the garrison and permanent organisation of Malta, as
well as over the proposed accession of the sultan to the treaty. Vain
attempts were also made by Joseph to retain Otranto for France till the
British should have evacuated Malta, and to secure the inclusion of the
Ligurian republic in the treaty.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE TREATY OF AMIENS.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_9" id="TOPIC_9"></a>At last on March 8 Napoleon agreed that no important difference remained,
and urged his brother to conclude the treaty. A little more time was
wasted in providing for a temporary occupation of Malta by Neapolitan
troops, and a more marked division of opinion arose as to the compensation
for the Prince of Orange. In spite of instructions to the contrary from
Hawkesbury, Cornwallis accepted an engagement on the part of France to
find a compensation, not defined, for the house of Nassau, instead of
charging it on the Dutch government; and the treaty was finally concluded
on March 25.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span> It was signed by Great Britain, France, Spain, and the
Batavian republic, while the Porte was admitted as an accessory power. It
differed from the preliminary convention in no important respect, except
in the illusory safeguards for the claims of the Prince of Orange, the
secret arrangement for evading the cost of the French prisoners, and the
provisions concerning Malta, pregnant with the seeds of future enmity.
These provisions were as follows: Malta was to be restored to the knights
of St. John, from whose order both French and British were hereafter to be
excluded. The evacuation was to take place within three months of the
ratification of the treaty, or sooner if possible. At that date Malta was
to be given up, provided the grand master or commissaries of the order
were present, and provided the Neapolitan garrison had arrived. Its
independence was to be under the guarantee of France, Great Britain,
Austria, Spain, Russia, and Prussia. Two thousand Neapolitan troops were
to occupy it for one year, and until the order should have raised a force
sufficient, in the judgment of the guaranteeing powers, for the defence of
the islands.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>On October 29, 1801, parliament was opened with a speech from the throne
briefly announcing the conclusion of a convention with the northern
powers, and of preliminaries of peace with the French republic. General
Lauriston, bearing the ratification of the preliminaries by the first
consul, had reached London on the 10th, when he was received by the
populace with tumultuous demonstrations of joy. Soon afterwards the "feast
of the peace" was celebrated in Paris with equal enthusiasm. Short-lived
as they proved to be, these pacific sentiments were doubtless genuine on
both sides of the channel. The industrial, though not the military,
resources of France were exhausted by her prodigious efforts during the
last eight years; while England, suffering grievously from distress among
the working-classes and financial difficulties, welcomed the prospect of
cheaper provisions and easier times, as well as of emerging from the
political difficulties originating in the French revolution.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_10" id="TOPIC_10"></a>The preliminary treaty, however, did not escape hostile criticism in
either house of parliament. It was the subject<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span> of discussion in the lords
on November 3, and in the commons on the 3rd and 4th. Its most strenuous
assailants were Lord Grenville, who had been foreign secretary under Pitt,
and the whigs who had joined Pitt's ministry in 1794, among whom Lords
Spencer and Fitzwilliam and above all Windham call for special notice.
Windham's powerful and comprehensive speech contained more than one shrewd
forecast of the future. For once, Pitt and Fox supported the same measure,
and Pitt, dwelling on <i>security</i> as our grand object in the war, specially
deprecated any attempt on the part of Great Britain "to settle the affairs
of the continent". Fox, in advocating peace, fiercely denounced the war
against the French republic, and gloated over the discomfiture of the
Bourbons.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> It was admitted on all sides that France was stronger than
ever in a military and political sense. She had already made treaties with
Austria, Naples, Spain, and Portugal; other treaties with Russia and
Turkey were on the point of being signed; while the still more important
concordat with the pope was already ratified. On the other hand, Great
Britain had largely increased her colonial possessions, and the chief
question now discussed was whether she would be the weaker for abandoning
some of these recent conquests. The general feeling of the nation was
fitly expressed by Sheridan in the phrase: "This is a peace which all men
are glad of, but no man can be proud of". Malmesbury, the negotiator of
Lille, was absent from the debates; but he has recorded in his diary his
disapproval both of the peace and of the violent opposition to it The king
told Malmesbury on November 26 that he considered it an experimental
peace, but unavoidable.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>DEBATES ON TREATY OF AMIENS.</i></div>

<p>The debates on the definitive treaty of Amiens took place on May 13 and
14, 1802, and though vigorously sustained, were to some extent a
repetition of those on the preliminaries of peace. The opposition to it
was headed by Grenville in the lords and in the commons by Windham, who
compared it unfavourably with the preliminaries; and the stipulations with
respect to Malta were justly criticised as one of its weakest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span> points.
Strange to say, Pitt took no effective part in the discussion, which ended
in overwhelming majorities for the government. As in the previous session,
domestic affairs, except in their bearing on foreign policy, received
comparatively little attention from parliament. The income tax was
repealed, almost in silence, as the first fruits of peace, and Addington,
as chancellor of the exchequer, delivered an emphatic eulogy on the
sinking fund by means of which he calculated that in forty-five years the
national debt, then amounting to &pound;500,000,000, might be entirely paid off.
The house of commons showed no want of economical zeal in scrutinising the
claims of the king on the civil list, and those of the Prince of Wales on
the revenues of the duchy of Cornwall. Nor did it neglect such abuses as
the non-residence of the parochial clergy, and the cruel practice of
bull-baiting, though it rejected a bill for the suppression of this
practice, after a characteristic apology for it from Windham, in which he
dwelt upon its superiority to horse-racing. In this session, too, a grant
of &pound;10,000 was voted to Jenner for his recent invention of vaccination. In
supporting it, Wilberforce stated that the victims of small-pox, in London
alone, numbered 4,000 annually.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_11" id="TOPIC_11"></a>The parliament, which had now lasted six years, was dissolved by the king
in person on June 28, and a general election was held during the month of
July. The new house of commons did not differ materially from the old, and
even in Ireland the recent national opposition to the union did not lead
to the unseating of a single member who had voted for it.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Meanwhile the
ministry was strengthened by the admission to office of Lord Castlereagh,
already distinguished for his share in the negotiations precedent to the
union with Ireland. On July 6 he was appointed president of the board of
control in succession to Dartmouth, and was admitted to a seat in the
cabinet in October. The new parliament did not meet till November 16.
During the interval members of both houses, with vast numbers of their
countrymen, flocked to Paris, which had been almost closed to English
travellers since the early days of the revolution. Fox was presented to
Napoleon, as Bonaparte, since the decree which made him consul for life,
preferred to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span> styled. Napoleon conceived a great admiration for him,
and afterwards persuaded himself that, had Fox survived, the friendly
relations of England and France would not have been permanently
interrupted. <a name="TOPIC_12" id="TOPIC_12"></a>On the very day on which parliament assembled, a conspiracy
was discovered, which, however insane it may now appear, attracted much
attention at the time. A certain Colonel Despard with thirty-six
followers, mainly labourers, had plotted to kill the king and seize all
the government-buildings, with a view to the establishment of what he
called the "constitutional independence of Ireland and Great Britain" and
the "equalisation of all civic rights". The conspiracy had no wide
ramifications, and the arrest of its leader and his companions brought it
to an immediate end. Despard was found guilty of high treason and was
executed on February 21, 1803.</p>

<p>When parliament met, the king's speech referred ominously to fresh
disturbances in the balance of power on the continent; and votes were
passed for large additions to the army and navy, in spite of Fox's
declaration that he saw no reason why Napoleon, satisfied with military
glory, should not henceforth devote himself to internal improvements in
France. Nelson, on the contrary, speaking in the house of lords, while he
professed himself a man of peace, insisted on the danger arising from "a
restless and unjust ambition on the part of our neighbours," and Sheridan
delivered a vigorous speech in a like spirit. On the whole, in January,
1803, the prospects of assured peace and prosperity were much gloomier
than they had been in January, 1802, before the treaty of Amiens. The
funds were going down, the bank restriction act was renewed, and Despard's
conspiracy still agitated the public mind. In the month of February a
strong anti-Gallican sentiment was roused by Mackintosh's powerful defence
of the royalist Jean Peltier, accused and ultimately convicted of a gross
libel on the first consul. On March 8 came the royal message calling out
the militia, which heralded the rupture of the peace.</p>

<p>The renewal of the war, fraught with so much glory and misery to both
nations, can have taken neither by surprise. The ink was scarcely dry on
the treaty of Amiens when fresh causes of discord sprung up between France
and Great Britain.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span> More than one of these, indeed, had arisen between the
signature of the preliminary convention and the actual conclusion of
peace. During the negotiations, the first consul had, as we have seen,
never ceased to protest against the violent attacks upon himself in the
English press, while Cornwallis persistently warned his own government
against the menacing attitude of France in Italy and elsewhere. The
proclamation of the concordat in April, 1802, and the recognition of
Napoleon as first consul for life in August, however they may have
strengthened his position in France, were no legitimate subjects for
resentment in England; but his acceptance of the presidency of the
"Italian" republic in January, followed by his annexation of Piedmont in
September, revived in all its intensity the British mistrust of his
aggressive policy.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>FRENCH AGGRESSIONS.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_13" id="TOPIC_13"></a>The month of October witnessed a renewed aggression on Switzerland. A
French army, commanded by Ney, advanced into the interior of the country,
and forced the Swiss, who were in the midst of a civil war, to accept the
mediation of Napoleon. The new constitution which he framed attempted, by
weakening the federal government, to place the direction of Helvetian
external relations in the hands of the French first consul. Our government
vainly endeavoured to resist this interference by sending agents with
money and promises. In Germany the redistribution of territory
necessitated by the peace of Lun&eacute;ville was carried out professedly under
the joint mediation of France and Russia, but really at the dictation of
Napoleon. The final project, which destroyed all except three of the
spiritual principalities and all except six of the free cities, was
proposed by France on February 23, 1803, and accepted by the Emperor
Francis on April 27.</p>

<p>Against these rearrangements, Great Britain could have nothing to say;
their importance is that while the negotiations were pending, Austria,
Prussia, and Russia all had a strong motive for standing well with France.
Bonaparte's attitude towards Switzerland was, in so far as it was backed
by force, an infringement of the treaty of Lun&eacute;ville, to which, however,
Great Britain was not a party. The neutrality of Piedmont had not been
safeguarded either at Lun&eacute;ville or at Amiens; it had already been occupied
by France before the treaty was signed, and Napoleon claimed to have as
much right to annex<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span> territory in Europe without the consent of Great
Britain as Great Britain had to annex territory in India without the
consent of France.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_14" id="TOPIC_14"></a>Napoleon's schemes of colonial expansion, though equally within the letter
of the treaty, were not less disconcerting. The reconquest of San Domingo
appeared necessary in order to obtain a base for the effective occupation
of the new French possession, Louisiana. The despatch of an expedition for
this purpose in December, 1801, had excited grave suspicion, and when
two-thirds of the army had died of yellow fever and the remainder had
returned home, fresh troops were sent out to take their place. A new naval
expedition was prepared in the Dutch port of Helvoetsluis, but it was
impossible to persuade British public opinion that its real destination
was San Domingo. Finally, on the eve of hostilities, in the spring of 1803
Napoleon, despairing of advance in this direction and disregarding the
Spanish right of pre-emption, sold Louisiana to the United States for
80,000,000 francs. Still more embarrassing was Bonaparte's eastern policy.
In September, 1802, Colonel S&eacute;bastiani was sent as "commercial agent" to
the Levant. He was instructed to inspect the condition of ports and
arsenals, to assure the sheykhs of French favour, and to report on the
military resources of Syria, Egypt, and the north African coast. His
report, which was published in the <i>Moniteur</i> of January 30, 1803, set
forth the opportunities that France would possess in the event of an
immediate return to hostilities, and was naturally interpreted as
disclosing an intention to renew the war on the first opportunity. Six
thousand French would, he said, be enough to reconquer Egypt; the country
was in favour of France. In March, 1803, Decaen left France with open
instructions to receive the surrender of the five towns in India restored
to France, but with secret orders to invite the alliance of Indian
sovereigns opposed to Great Britain. On his appearance at Pondicherri, the
British commander prepared to seize him, but he escaped to the Mauritius,
which he put in a state of defence, and made a basis for attacks on
British commerce which lasted from 1803 to 1811.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CAUSES OF MISTRUST AFTER AMIENS.</i></div>

<p>Ireland also was visited by political spies, passing as commercial agents.
It may not be easy to say how far Emmet's rebellion, to be recorded
hereafter, was the result of these visits.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span> At all events a letter fell
into the hands of the British government, addressed by Talleyrand to a
French agent at Dublin, called Fauvelet, directing him to obtain answers
to a series of questions about the military and naval circumstances of the
district, and "to procure a plan of the ports, with the soundings and
moorings, and to state the draught of water, and the wind best suited for
ingress and egress". The British government naturally complained of these
instructions, but Talleyrand persistently maintained that they were of a
purely commercial character.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> It is, of course, true that these
preparations in view of a possible recurrence of hostilities, however
obvious their intention, were not in themselves hostile acts. Still, they
were just grounds for suspicion, and, with our retrospective knowledge of
Napoleon's later career, we may seek in vain for the grounds of confidence
which had made the conclusion of a treaty possible. Great Britain was
guilty of more direct breaches of the peace of Amiens. Russia refused her
guarantee for the independence of Malta, and the British government was
therefore technically justified in retaining it. No similar justification
could, however, be alleged for the retention of Alexandria and the French
towns in India. These measures were, as will be seen, defended on broader
grounds of public policy. Not the least of the causes of discontent with
the new situation was the refusal of Napoleon to follow up the treaty of
peace with a commercial treaty. He had even retained French troops in
Holland, and thus shown that he meant to close its ports against British
commerce. The hope of a renewal of trade with France had been a main cause
of the popular desire for peace, and had reconciled the British public to
the sacrifices with which the treaty of Amiens had been purchased. It soon
became clear that further concessions would be made the price of a
commercial treaty, and it was felt in consequence that the sacrifices
already made were made in vain.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_15" id="TOPIC_15"></a>In September, 1802, Lord Whitworth was sent as ambassador extraordinary to
the French Republic. The instructions which he carried with him from
Hawkesbury fully reflect the prevailing spirit of mistrust. He was to
watch for any new leagues which might prejudice England or disturb
Europe;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span> he was to discover any secret designs that might be formed
against the East or West Indies; he was to maintain the closest
surveillance over the internal politics of France, but especially over the
dispositions of influential personages in the confidence of the first
consul, as well as over the financial resources and armaments of the
republic.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Two months later, he was expressly warned in a secret
despatch not in any way to commit His Majesty to a restoration of Malta,
even if the provisions made at Amiens for this purpose could be completely
executed; and the principle was laid down, from which the British
government never swerved, that Great Britain was entitled to compensation
for any acquisitions made by France since the treaty was signed.
Accordingly, the retention of Malta was justified as a counterpoise to
French extensions of territory in Italy, the invasion of Switzerland, and
the continued occupation of the Batavian republic.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> This resolution was
naturally confirmed by the publication of S&eacute;bastiani's report.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>NAPOLEON AND WHITWORTH.</i></div>

<p>The long negotiations between Whitworth and the French government, during
the winter of 1802 and the spring of 1803, only bring into stronger relief
the importance of the issues thus raised, and the hopelessness of a
pacific solution. Napoleon firmly took his stand throughout on the simple
letter of the treaty, which pledged Great Britain, upon certain
conditions, to place the knights of St. John in possession of Malta, but
did not contemplate the case of further accessions of French territory on
the continent. Although the conditions specified were never fully
satisfied, it is abundantly clear that the British ministers, having at
last grasped the value of Malta, created all the difficulties in their
power, and determined to cancel this article of the treaty. They alleged,
in self-defence, that the spirit of the treaty had been constantly
violated by Napoleon, in repeated acts of hostility to British subjects,
in the refusal of all redress for such grievances, and, above all, in that
series of aggressions on the continent which he declared to be outside the
treaty and beyond the province of Great Britain.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> None of the
compromises laboriously discussed in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span> the winter of 1802 betoken any
desire on the part of either government to retreat from its main position,
though it does not follow that either sought to bring about a renewal of
the war. Whitworth constantly reported that no formidable armaments were
being prepared, and clung for months to a belief that Napoleon, knowing
the instability of his own power and the ruinous state of his finances,
would ultimately give way. On the other hand, Talleyrand and Joseph
Bonaparte never ceased to hope that Great Britain would make concessions
which might be accepted.</p>

<p>Such hopes were rudely dispelled by the king's message to parliament on
March 8, 1803, complaining of aggressive preparations in the ports of
France and Holland, and recommending immediate measures for the security
of his dominions. This message, with the consequent embodiment of the
militia, startled the whole continent, and was followed five days later by
the famous scene in which the first consul addressed Whitworth in phrases
little short of insult. During a public audience at the Tuileries on the
13th, Napoleon, after inquiring whether the British ambassador had
received any news from home, broke out with the words: "And so you are
determined to go to war". The altercation which ensued is best told in
Whitworth's own words<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'No, first consul,' I replied, 'we are too sensible of the advantages of
peace.' 'We have,' said he, 'been fighting these fifteen years.' As he
seemed to wait for an answer, I observed only, 'That is already too long'.
'But,' said he, 'you desire to fight for fifteen years more, and you are
forcing me to it,' I told him that was very far from his majesty's
intentions. He then proceeded to Count Marcoff and the Chevalier Azzara,
who were standing together at a little distance from me, and said to them,
'The English are bent on war, but if they are the first to draw the sword,
I shall be the last to put it back into the scabbard. They do not respect
treaties. They must be covered with black crape.' I suppose he meant the
treaties. He then went his round, and was thought by all those to whom he
addressed himself to betray great signs of irritation. In a few minutes he
came back to me, to my great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span> annoyance, and resumed the conversation, if
such it can be called, by something personally civil to me. He then began
again, 'Why these armaments? Against whom these measures of precaution? I
have not a single ship of the line in the French ports; but if you wish to
arm, I will arm also; if you wish to fight, I will fight also. You may
perhaps kill France, but will never intimidate her.' 'We wish,' said I,
'neither the one nor the other. We wish to live on good terms with her.'
'You must respect treaties then,' replied he; 'woe to those who do not
respect treaties; they shall answer for it to all Europe.'"</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_16" id="TOPIC_16"></a>Too much stress has been laid upon this incident, so characteristic of
Napoleon's studied impetuosity. Little more than a fortnight later he
received the British ambassador with courtesy. Overtures now succeeded
overtures, and much was expected on both sides from the influence of the
Tsar Alexander, to whom France suggested that Malta might be ceded.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> At
the last moment, a somewhat more conciliatory disposition was shown by the
French diplomatists; and the British government was blamed by its
opponents, alike for having failed to break off the negotiations earlier
on the broadest grounds, and for breaking them off too abruptly on grounds
of doubtful validity. But we now see that national enmity, fostered by the
press on both sides, rendered friendly relations impossible, and that,
even had Napoleon been willing to refrain from aggressions, peace was
impossible. On May 12, two months after the king's message, Whitworth,
having presented an ultimatum, finally quitted Paris. A few days later an
order was issued for the detention of all British subjects then resident
in France, and justified on the ground that French seamen (but not
passengers) were liable to capture at sea. On June 10 Talleyrand announced
the occupation of Hanover and the treatment as enemies of Hanoverian
soldiers serving under the King of Great Britain. Meanwhile, on May 16,
the rupture of peaceful relations was announced to both houses of
parliament; on May 18 war was declared, and in June volunteers were
already mustering to resist invasion.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h3>THE RETURN OF PITT.</h3>


<p><a name="TOPIC_17" id="TOPIC_17"></a>The period following the rupture of the peace of Amiens, though crowded
with military events of the highest importance, was inevitably barren in
social and political interest. Disappointed in its hopes of returning
prosperity, the nation girded itself up with rare unanimity for a renewed
contest. In July the income-tax was reinstituted and a bill was actually
carried authorising a levy <i>en masse</i> in case of invasion. Pending its
enforcement, the navy was vigorously recruited by means of the press-gang;
the yeomanry were called out, and a force of infantry volunteers was
enrolled, which reached a total of 300,000 in August, and of nearly
400,000 at the beginning of the next session. Pitt himself, as warden of
the Cinque Ports, took command of 3,000 volunteers in Kent, and contrasted
in parliament the warlike enthusiasm of the country with the alleged
apathy of the ministry. On July 23 a rebellion broke out in Ireland,
instigated by French agents and headed by a young man named Robert Emmet.
The conspiracy was ill planned and in itself insignificant, but the
recklessness of the conspirators was equalled by the weakness of the civil
and military authorities, who neglected to take any precautions in spite
of the plainest warnings. The rebels had intended to attack Dublin Castle
and seize the person of the lord lieutenant, who was to be held as a
hostage; but they dared not make the attempt, and after parading the
streets for a few hours were dispersed by the spontaneous action of a few
determined officers with a handful of troops, but not before Lord
Kilwarden, the chief justice, and several other persons, had been cruelly
murdered by Emmet's followers. Futile as the rising was, it sufficed to
show that union was not a sovereign remedy for Irish disaffection<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_18" id="TOPIC_18"></a>Meanwhile the relations between the prime minister and his predecessor had
been growing less and less cordial. Throughout the year 1801 Pitt was
still the friend and informal adviser of the ministry, and it is difficult
to overrate the value of his support as a ground of confidence in an
administration, personally popular, but known to be deficient in
intellectual brilliance. In 1802 he generally stood aloof, and though in
June of that year he corrected the draft of the king's speech, he absented
himself from parliament, for he was dissatisfied with the measures adopted
by government. His dissatisfaction was known to his friends, and in
November a movement was set on foot by Canning to induce Addington to
withdraw in Pitt's favour; but Pitt, though willing to resume office,
refused to allow the ministry to be approached on the subject. He
preferred to wait till a general wish for his return to power should be
manifested. In December he visited Grenville at Dropmore, and expressed a
certain discontent with the government.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> It was his intention still to
treat the ministers with tenderness, but to return to parliament and
criticise their policy. It is easy to see that his object at this date was
not to drive the government from office, but to give rise to a desire to
re-enlist his own talents in the service of the country, and thus prepare
the way for a peaceable resumption of the position he had abandoned in the
preceding year.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>NEGOTIATIONS FOR PITT'S RETURN.</i></div>

<p>No sooner had rumours of Pitt's willingness to resume office reached
Addington in the last days of December, than he opened negotiations with
Pitt with a view to effecting this object. Pitt did not receive his
overtures very warmly. He doubtless wished to be brought back because he
was felt to be indispensable, without any appearance of intrigue. Time was
in his favour, and he allowed the negotiations to proceed slowly. As the
proposals took shape, it became clear that Addington did not wish to be
openly superseded by Pitt, but preferred that they should serve together
as secretaries of state under a third person; and Addington even suggested
Pitt's brother, the Earl of Chatham, then master-general of the ordnance,
as a suitable prime minister. Pitt's reply, communicated to Addington by
Dundas, now Viscount Melville, in a letter dated March<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span> 22, 1803, was to
the effect that Pitt would not accept any position in the government
except that of prime minister, with which was to be coupled the office of
chancellor of the exchequer. Addington readily acceded to Pitt's claim to
this position, but Grenville refused to serve in a ministry where
Addington and Hawkesbury held "any efficient offices of real business,"
and Addington declined to abandon ministerial office for a speakership of
the house of lords, which Pitt proposed to create for him. Finally, on
April 10, Pitt at a private conference with Addington proposed as an
indispensable condition of his own return to office that Melville,
Spencer, Grenville, and Windham should become members of his cabinet. This
meant a reconstruction of the whole ministry, and Pitt stipulated that the
changes should be made by the king's desire and on the recommendation of
the existing ministry.</p>

<p>The situation had become an impossible one. Nothing was more reasonable
than that Pitt, the friend and protector of the existing ministry, should
assume the direction of affairs now that the nation appeared to be on the
brink of war. But Pitt could not honourably desert those former
colleagues, who had resigned with him on the catholic question. Two of
these, however, Grenville and Windham, though doubtless men of the highest
capacity, had bitterly attacked the existing ministry; and it was not to
be expected that that ministry, supported as it still was by overwhelming
majorities in both houses of parliament, supported as it had hitherto been
by Pitt himself, should consent to admit its opponents to a share of
office. It is highly improbable that Grenville and Windham would then have
co-operated with Addington and Hawkesbury, and their admission to office
would have ruined the cohesion of the cabinet, unless it had been
accompanied by the retirement of the leading members of the existing
ministry which Pitt's previous attitude, together with the actual balance
of parties in parliament, rendered it impossible to demand. How difficult
it was to induce Grenville and Windham to enter into any combination
future years were to prove. For the present the ministry took not merely
the wisest, but the only course open to it. Addington, after vainly
endeavouring to induce Pitt to modify his terms, laid them before a
cabinet council on April 13; they were immediately rejected, though the
cabinet declared<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span> itself ready to admit to office Pitt himself and those
of his colleagues who had hitherto acted with the Addington ministry. Pitt
could hardly have expected any other reply. No ministry could have granted
such terms except on the supposition that Pitt was indispensable, and Pitt
for the present hardly claimed such a position.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>But if Pitt did not consider himself indispensable, his friends did, and
both he and others came gradually to adopt their view. The rejection of
his terms left him free to adopt the line of policy that he had sketched
to Grenville in the previous December. He had not to wait long for an
opportunity, but in the opinion of Pitt's friends at least the first
provocation came from Addington. Unable to strengthen his ministry by any
accession from Pitt and his followers, he had turned to the "old
opposition," the whigs who, under the leadership of Fox, had consistently
advocated a pacific policy. These had recently supported the ministry
against the "new opposition," as the followers of Grenville and Windham
were called. But since 1797 Fox and the majority of the "old opposition"
had generally absented themselves from parliament, and George Tierney,
member for Southwark, had led what was left of their party.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> He now
received and accepted the offer of the treasurership of the navy, one of
the most important of the offices below cabinet rank. As a speaker Tierney
was a valuable addition to the government which was sadly deficient in
debating power; he had, however, been particularly bitter in his attacks
on Pitt, with whom he had fought a duel in 1798, and had provoked the
sarcastic wit of Canning, in whose well-known parody, "The Friend of
Humanity and the Knife-grinder" (1798), the original illustration by
Gillray depicted the friend of humanity with the features of Tierney and
laid the scene in the borough of Southwark.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CHANGES IN ADDINGTON'S MINISTRY.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_19" id="TOPIC_19"></a>The appointment, which Pitt himself does not appear to have resented, was
announced on June 1, and Tierney took his place on the treasury bench on
the 3rd. On the same evening Colonel Patten moved a series of resolutions
condemning, in extravagant terms, the conduct of the ministry in the
negotia<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>tion with France. Pitt seized the opportunity to move the orders
of the day. In other words, he proposed that the question should be left
undecided. He expressed the opinion that the ministry was not free from
blame, but declared himself unable to concur in all the charges against
it. He considered further that to drive the existing ministers out of
office would only throw the country into confusion, and that it was
therefore inadvisable to pursue the question. To this the ministerial
speakers replied by demanding a direct censure or a total acquittal, and
the consequent division served only to display the weakness of the
opposition. The Addington, Fox, and Grenville parties combined to oppose
Pitt's motion, which was rejected by 333 votes against 56. Pitt and Fox,
and their respective followers then left the house, leaving the
ministerial party and the Grenville party to decide the fate of Patten's
resolutions, which were negatived by 275 votes against 34. A comparison of
the figures of the two divisions, allowing for tellers, gives as the
voting strength of Pitt's party 58, of Grenville's 36, of Fox's 22, and of
Addington's 277. Of these the Grenville party alone desired to eject the
ministers from office, while Fox's party openly professed a preference for
Addington over Pitt.</p>

<p>During the remainder of the session Pitt seldom took any part in
parliamentary business, and never opposed the ministry on any question of
importance. On August 12 parliament was prorogued after a session lasting
nearly nine months, and the prime minister embraced the opportunity of
making some slight reconstructions in the ministry. Pelham, who was
removed from the home office, resigned his place in the cabinet, and was
shortly afterwards consoled with the chancellorship of the duchy of
Lancaster, an office which was not yet definitely recognised as political.
Charles Philip Yorke, son of the chancellor who died in 1770 and
half-brother of the third Earl of Hardwicke, resigned the office of
secretary at war and succeeded to the home office on the 17th. It was also
considered advisable to strengthen the ministry in the upper house, where
Grenville's oratory gave the opposition a decided advantage in debating
power, and Hawkesbury was accordingly summoned to the lords on November 16
in his father's barony of Hawkesbury. After this rearrangement the cabinet
contained eight<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span> peers and three commoners, no illiberal allowance of
commoners according to the ideas of the age. The recess was further marked
by a violent war of pamphlets between the followers of Addington and Pitt,
which began early in September, and which, although no politician of the
first order took any direct part in it, did much to embitter the relations
of their respective parties.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> Not less irritating were the <i>jeux
d'esprit</i> with which Canning continued to assail the ministry in the
newspaper press.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> The most famous of these is the couplet:&mdash;</p>

prime minister as "Happy Britain's guardian gander". The following verses

</div></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE KING'S ILLNESS.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_20" id="TOPIC_20"></a>When parliament reassembled on November 22 the opposition was still
disunited, and, though Windham severely condemned the inadequacy of the
provision made for national defence, he did not venture to divide against
the government. But during the Christmas recess a distinct step was made
towards the consolidation of the opposition by the reunion of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span> the two
sections of the whig party. Grenville had conceived a chimerical project
of replacing the existing administration by one which should include all
statesmen possessed of real political talent, whatever their differences
in the past might have been. True to this policy, he persuaded Fox in
January, 1804, to join him in attempting to expel the Addington
administration from office as an essential preliminary to any further
action. Sheridan, however, with some of the Prince of Wales's friends,
still refused to enter into any combination which might result in the
return of Pitt to power. The parliamentary session was resumed on February
1, but the course of events was complicated by a recurrence of the king's
malady. Symptoms of this were observed towards the end of January; the
disease took a turn for the worse about February 12, and on the 14th it
was made known to the public. For a short time the king's life appeared to
be in danger; his reason was affected during a longer interval, but the
attack was in every way milder than in 1789, and on March 7 Dr. Simmons
reported to Addington that "the king was competent to perform any act of
government".<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> It is true that for many months the king's health did not
allow him to give his full attention to public business, but there was
nothing to prevent him from attending to such routine work as was
absolutely necessary. There could, however, be no question of a change of
ministers till there should be a marked improvement in the king's health.</p>

<p>The king's illness was made the occasion on February 27 of a motion by Sir
Robert Lawley for the adjournment of the house of commons. This was
parried by Addington with the statement that there was no necessary
suspension of such royal functions as it might be necessary for His
Majesty to discharge at the present moment.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> The emphasis here
obviously lay on the word "necessary". A still bolder course was adopted
shortly afterwards by the lord chancellor. When on March 9 the king's
assent to several bills was given by commission, Fitzwilliam raised not
unreasonable doubts as to whether the king was capable of resuming the
functions of government. Eldon, however, declared that, as the result of a
private interview with the king, he had come to the conclusion that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
royal commissioners were warranted in assenting to the bills in question.
Whether the chancellor was justified in assuming this responsibility must
remain doubtful; at all events Pitt seems to have determined that the time
was now ripe for a ministerial crisis. He had on February 27 criticised
both the military and naval defences of the country, but he would not
directly attack the government till the king's health was in a better
condition. At last, on March 15, the first attack was made. Pitt selected
the weak point in the administration. St. Vincent's obstinacy in refusing
to believe in the possibility of a renewal of hostility and his excessive
economy had brought about a marked deterioration in the strength and
quality of the fleet. Pitt accordingly moved for an inquiry into the
administration of the navy. Fox dissociated himself from Pitt's attacks on
the first lord of the admiralty, but supported the motion on the ground
that an inquiry would clear St. Vincent's character. On a division the
government had a majority of 201 against 130. On the 19th, however, Pitt
refused to join the Grenvilles in supporting Fox's motion for the
re-committal of the volunteer consolidation bill. On the following day
Eldon made overtures to Pitt, and on the 23rd Pitt dined <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i>
with the chancellor, but no record has been preserved of the nature of
their negotiations.</p>

<p>On the 29th Pitt, in a letter to Melville, explained his position at
length. He intended, as soon after the Easter recess as the king's health
should permit, to write to the king explaining the dangers which, in his
opinion, threatened the crown and people from the continuance of the
existing government, and representing the urgent necessity of a speedy
change; he would prefer an administration from which no political party
should be excluded, but was unwilling, especially in view of the king's
state of health, to force any minister upon him; if, therefore, he should
be invited by the king to form a ministry from which the partisans of Fox
and Grenville were to be excluded, he was prepared to form one from his
own followers united with the more capable members of the existing
government, excluding Addington himself and St. Vincent; should this
measure fail of success, he would "have no hesitation in taking such
ground in Parliament as would be most likely to attain the object".<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
As it happened, the parliamentary assault preceded the correspondence with
the king. Immediately after the recess the ministry laid before parliament
military proposals which Pitt felt bound to resist. On April 16 Pitt,
supported by Windham, opposed the third reading of a bill for augmenting
the Irish militia, and expressed a preference for the army of reserve. He
was defeated by the narrow majority of 128 against 107. On the 23rd Fox
proposed to refer the question of national defence to a committee of the
whole house. He was supported by Pitt and Windham, and defeated by 256
votes only against 204. The division which sealed the fate of the ministry
was taken two days later on a motion that the house should go into
committee on a bill for the suspension of the army of reserve. This was
opposed by Pitt, who expounded a rival plan for the diminution of the
militia and increase of the army of reserve. Fox and Windham demanded for
Pitt's scheme a right to consideration, and on a division the motion was
carried by no more than 240 against 203. The division of April 16 had
convinced Addington that a reconciliation with Pitt was necessary. On
Pitt's refusing to confer with him, he agreed to recommend the king to
charge Eldon with the task of discovering Pitt's views as to the formation
of a new ministry, in case the king wished to learn them.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>ADDINGTON'S RESIGNATION.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_21" id="TOPIC_21"></a>The king, however, expressed no such wish, and on April 22 Pitt sent an
unsealed letter to Eldon to be laid before the king; announcing his
dissatisfaction with the ministry and his intention of declaring this
dissatisfaction in parliament.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> It was not till the 27th that Eldon
found a suitable opportunity of communicating Pitt's letter to the king.
Before that date Addington, who considered that he could no longer remain
in office with dignity after the divisions of the 23rd and 25th, had on
the 26th informed the king of his intention to resign. The king
reluctantly consented to his resignation, which was announced to the
cabinet on the 29th. On the following day Eldon called on Pitt with a
request from the king for a plan of a new administration. Pitt replied in
a letter, setting forth at great length the arguments in favour of a
combined administration, and requesting permission to confer with Fox and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
Grenville about the construction of the ministry.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> The letter irritated
the king, who demanded a renewed pledge against catholic emancipation,
with which Grenville was specially associated in his mind, and refused to
admit Pitt to office if he persevered in his purpose of consulting Fox and
Grenville. Pitt then declared his adherence to the pledge given in
1801<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> and requested an interview with the king. The interview, which
took place on May 7, lasted three hours, and ended in a compromise. The
king agreed to admit Grenville and his friends to office, but, while ready
to accept the friends of Fox, he refused, as much on personal as on
political grounds, to give Fox a place in the cabinet. At the same time he
declared himself ready to grant him a diplomatic appointment. At a later
date the king went the length of declaring that, rather than accept Fox,
he would have incurred the risk of civil war.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>PITT'S RETURN TO OFFICE.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_22" id="TOPIC_22"></a>Fox readily agreed to his own exclusion, which he had fully expected, and
urged his followers to join Pitt, but Grenville and his friends refused to
serve without Fox, while the friends of Fox and the more immediate
followers of Addington refused to serve without their respective leaders.
Addington always considered that Pitt had treated him ungenerously in
driving him from office, when it was open to him to return to the head of
affairs with the full consent of the existing ministers. More recently it
has been the fashion to blame Pitt for bringing too little pressure to
bear upon the king and thus losing the support of Fox and Grenville.
Neither charge appears to be justified. Through the whole length of the
Addington administration Pitt showed himself fully sensitive of what was
due to the king, with whom he had worked cordially for eighteen years, to
Grenville who had resigned in his cause, and to Addington who had assumed
office under his protection. There was no trace of faction in Pitt's
attitude towards the ministry. He merely opposed what he believed to be
dangerous to the country, and when he was convinced of the necessity of
removing Addington from a share in public business, he endeavoured to
effect his purpose in such a way as to give the minimum of offence.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_23" id="TOPIC_23"></a>On the other hand, Pitt's intended combination in a supreme crisis of his
country's destiny with his life-long antagonist, Fox, was a heroic
experiment, perhaps, but still only an experiment. The failure of the
ministry of "All the Talents" renders it exceedingly doubtful whether such
an alliance would have proved successful, and Fox's lukewarm patriotism
would have been dearly purchased at the expense of the alienation of the
king, perhaps even of his relapse into insanity. Nor is it certain that
the strongest pressure would have induced George III. to accept Fox at
this date. Addington was still undefeated and might have remained in
office if Pitt had refused to assume the reins of government without Fox.
Grenville is undoubtedly more responsible than any one else for the
weakness of Pitt's second administration. It was from a sense of loyalty
to Grenville that Pitt had suffered the negotiations for his return to
office in 1803 to fall through, and now when the two statesmen could
return together, and when, if ever, a strong government was needed, either
a quixotic sense of honour or a wounded pride induced Grenville not only
to stand aloof from the new administration himself, but to do his utmost
to prevent others from giving it their support.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> The new cabinet was
quickly formed. Pitt received the seals of office on May 10, and took his
seat in parliament after re-election on the 18th, the very day on which
Napoleon was declared emperor by the French senate.</p>

<p>This event, long foreseen, was doubtless hastened by the disclosure of the
plot formed by Moreau, Pichegru, and Georges Cadoudal against the first
consul. There was no proof of Moreau's complicity in designs on Napoleon's
life, and the mysterious death of Pichegru in prison left the extent of
his complicity among the insoluble problems of history, but there can be
no doubt that Cadoudal was justly executed for plotting assassination.
Unfortunately some of the under-secretaries in the Addington
administration had not only shared the plans of the conspirators so far as
they aimed at a rising in France, but had procured for them material
assistance. They appear, however, to have been innocent of any attempt on
Napoleon's life. Drake, the British envoy at Munich, was, however, deeper
in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span> the plot. The evidence of British complicity naturally received the
very worst construction in Paris.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> Napoleon himself certainly believed
in an Anglo-Bourbon conspiracy, organised by the Count of Artois and other
French royalists, when he caused the Duke of Enghien to be kidnapped in
Baden territory and hurried off to the castle of Vincennes. He was,
however, already aware of his prisoner's innocence when on March 21 he had
him shot there by torch-light after a mock trial before a military
commission. All Europe was shocked by this atrocious assassination, and
though Napoleon sometimes attempted to shift the guilt of it upon
Talleyrand, he justified it at other times as a measure of self-defence,
and left on record his deliberate approval of it, for the consideration of
posterity. Two months later he became Emperor of the French.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_24" id="TOPIC_24"></a>When Pitt resumed office on May 10, 1804, he was no longer the heaven-born
and buoyant young minister of 1783, strong in the confidence of the king
and the anticipated confidence of the nation, with a minority of followers
in the house of commons, but with the brightest prospects of political
success before him. Nor was he the leader of a devoted majority, as when
he resigned in 1801 rather than abandon his convictions on the catholic
question. He had been compelled to waive these convictions, without fully
regaining the confidence of the king, and, while the adherents of Fox
retained their deep-seated hatred of a war-policy, the adherents of
Addington and Grenville were in no mood to give him a loyal support.
Windham and Spencer were no longer at his side, and his ministry was
essentially the same as that of Addington, with the substitution of Dudley
Ryder, now Lord Harrowby, for Hawkesbury as foreign secretary, Melville
for St. Vincent as first lord of the admiralty, Earl Camden for Hobart as
secretary for war and the colonies, and the Duke of Montrose for Auckland
as president of the board of trade. Hawkesbury was transferred to the home
office, vacated by Yorke, and the new chancellor of the duchy of
Lancaster, Lord Mulgrave, was given a seat in the cabinet. Of Pitt's
eleven colleagues in the cabinet Castlereagh alone, who remained president
of the board of control&mdash;a wretched speaker though an able
administrator&mdash;had a seat in the lower house.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>PITT'S RECONCILIATION WITH ADDINGTON.</i></div>

<p>Military exigencies now engrossed all thoughts, and the king's speech, in
proroguing parliament on July 31, foreshadowed a new coalition, for which
the murder of the Duke of Enghien had paved the way. The preparations for
an invasion of England had been resumed, and Napoleon celebrated his
birthday in great state at Boulogne, still postponing his final stroke
until he should be crowned, on December 2, at Paris by the helpless pope,
brought from Italy for the purpose.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> A month later he personally
addressed another pacific letter to the King of England, who replied in
his speech from the throne on January 15, 1805, that he could not
entertain overtures except in concert with Russia and the other powers.
Meanwhile, Pitt, conscious as he was of failing powers, retained his
undaunted courage, and while he was organising a third coalition, did not
shrink from a bold measure which could hardly be justified by
international law. This was the seizure on October 5, 1804, of three
Spanish treasure-ships on the high seas, without a previous declaration of
war against Spain, though not without a previous notice that hostilities
might be opened at any moment unless Spain ceased to give underhand
assistance to France. The excuse was that Spain had long been the
obsequious ally of France, and, as the alliance now became open, Pitt's
act was sanctioned by a large majority in both houses of parliament in
January, 1805. The parliamentary session which opened in this month found
Pitt's ministry apparently stronger than it had been at the beginning of
the recess. Despairing of any help from Grenville, except in a vigorous
prosecution of the war, he had sought a reconciliation with Addington, who
became Viscount Sidmouth on January 12 and president of the council on the
14th. Along with Sidmouth his former colleague Hobart, now Earl of
Buckinghamshire, returned to office as chancellor of the duchy. To make
room for these new allies, Portland had consented to resign the presidency
of the council, though he remained a member of the cabinet, while Mulgrave
was appointed to the foreign office, in place of Harrowby, who was
compelled by ill-health to retire.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_25" id="TOPIC_25"></a>But this new accession of strength was soon followed by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span> a terrible
mortification which probably contributed to shorten Pitt's life. Melville,
his tried supporter and intimate friend, was charged on the report of a
commission with having misapplied public money as treasurer of the navy in
Pitt's former ministry. It appeared that he had been culpably careless,
and had not prevented the paymaster, Trotter, from engaging in private
speculations with the naval balances. Although Trotter's speculations
involved no loss to the state they were, nevertheless, a contravention of
an act of 1785. Melville had also supplied other departments of government
with naval money, but was personally innocent of fraud. There was a
divergence of feeling in the cabinet as to the attitude to be adopted
towards Melville. Sidmouth, himself a man of the highest integrity, was a
friend of St. Vincent, the late first lord of the admiralty, and had not
forgiven Melville for his part in the expulsion of himself and St. Vincent
from office. He had therefore both public and private grounds to incline
him against Melville. On April 8, Samuel Whitbread moved a formal censure
on Melville in the house of commons. Pitt, with the approval of Sidmouth
and his friends, moved the previous question on Whitbread's motion, and
declared his intention of introducing a motion of his own for a select
committee to investigate the charges. In spite of the support which Pitt
derived from the followers of Sidmouth the votes were equally divided on
Whitbread's motion, 216 a side. Abbot, the speaker, gave his casting vote
in favour of Whitbread, and the announcement was received by the whig
members with unseemly exultation.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>MINISTERIAL CHANGES.</i></div>

<p>The censure was followed by an impeachment before the house of lords,
where Melville was acquitted in the following year. Meanwhile, he had
resigned office on April 9, the day after the vote of censure, and his
place at the admiralty was taken by Sir Charles Middleton, who was raised
to the peerage as Lord Barham. The appointment gave umbrage to Sidmouth,
to whom Pitt had made promises of promotion for his own followers, and he
was with difficulty induced to remain in the cabinet. Pitt was, however,
irritated by the hostile votes of Sidmouth's followers, Hiley Addington
and Bond, on the question of the impeachment, and regarded this as a
reason<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span> for delaying their preferment. Sidmouth now complained of a breach
of faith, as Pitt had promised to treat the question as an open one, and
he resigned office on July 4. Buckinghamshire resigned next day. Camden
was appointed to succeed Sidmouth as lord president, Castlereagh followed
Camden as secretary for war and the colonies, retaining his previous
position as president of the board of control, and Harrowby, whose health
had improved since his resignation in January, took Buckinghamshire's
place as chancellor of the duchy. Thus weakened at home, Pitt could derive
little consolation from the aspect of continental affairs. On May 26,
Napoleon was crowned King of Italy in the cathedral of Milan, and the
Ligurian Republic became part of the French empire in the following month.
The ascendency of France in Europe might well have appeared impregnable,
and it might have been supposed that nothing remained for England but to
guard her own coasts and recapture some of the French colonies given up by
the treaty of Amiens.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_26" id="TOPIC_26"></a>But Pitt's spirit was still unbroken, and by the middle of July he
succeeded in rallying three powers, Russia, Austria, and Sweden, into a
league to withstand the further encroachments of France. Such a league had
been proposed by Gustavus IV. of Sweden, early in 1804, but nothing
definite was done till Pitt's ministry entered upon office. Meanwhile, the
assassination of the Duke of Enghien had led to a rupture of diplomatic
relations between France and Russia, though war was not declared.
Negotiations were presently set on foot for a league, which, it was hoped,
would be joined by Austria and Prussia in addition to Great Britain,
Russia, and Sweden. An interesting feature in the negotiations was the
tsar's scheme of a European polity, where the states should be independent
and enjoy institutions "founded on the sacred rights of humanity," a
foreshadowing, as it would seem, of the Holy Alliance. The discussion of
details between Great Britain and Russia began towards the end of 1804.
Difficulties, however, arose about the British retention of Malta and the
British claim to search neutral ships for deserters. A treaty between the
two powers was signed on April 11, 1805; but the tsar long refused his
ratification, and it was only given in July, after a formal protest
against the retention of Malta.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p>The object of this alliance was defined to be the expulsion of French
troops from North Germany, the assured independence of the republics of
Holland and Switzerland, and the restoration of the King of Sardinia in
Piedmont; 500,000 men were to be provided for the war by Russia and such
other continental powers as might join the coalition. Great Britain,
instead of furnishing troops, was to supply &pound;1,250,000 a year for every
100,000 men engaged in the war. After the close of the war an European
congress was to define more closely the law of nations and establish an
European federation. At the same time the allies disclaimed the intention
of forcing any system of government on France against her will. It will be
observed that the number of troops specified was far in excess of what
Russia alone could place in the field; such numbers could only be obtained
by the adhesion of Austria and of either Prussia or some of the smaller
German states to the coalition. So far as Austria was concerned,
Napoleon's Italian policy rendered war inevitable. Already in November,
1804, the Austrian court had entered into a secret agreement with Russia
to make war on France in the event of further French aggressions in Italy.
The coronation of Napoleon as King of Italy and the annexation of Liguria
were, however, more than aggressions; they were open violations of the
treaty of Lun&eacute;ville which had guaranteed the independence of the Cisalpine
and Ligurian republics. Austria hereupon determined on war, and secretly
joined the coalition on August 9, 1805. Sweden, which was not a member of
it, concluded separate treaties of alliance both with Great Britain and
with Russia. Greater difficulties had to be surmounted in the case of
Prussia. Frederick William III. cherished no enthusiasm for European
liberty, and vacillated under the influence of Napoleon's offer of Hanover
on the one hand and his numerous petty insults on the other. Prussia in
consequence remained neutral throughout the most decisive period of the
ensuing war.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>NELSON AND VILLENEUVE.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_27" id="TOPIC_27"></a>Long before the coalition was ready Napoleon's mind had recurred to his
venturesome project for the invasion of England. An army, the finest that
he ever led to victory, which, even after it had been transferred to
another scene of action, he still saw fit to call the "army of England,"
was encamped near Boulogne. It was constantly exercised in the process of
em<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>barking on board flat-bottomed boats or rafts, which were to be
convoyed by Villeneuve, admiral of the Toulon fleet, and Gantheaume,
admiral of the Brest fleet, for whose appearance the French signalmen
vainly scanned the horizon. In the meantime, Nelson had been engaged for
two years, without setting foot on shore, in that patient and sleepless
watch, ranging over the whole Mediterranean, which must ever rank with the
greatest of his matchless exploits. At last, he learned in the spring of
1805, that Villeneuve, following a plan concerted by Napoleon himself, had
eluded him by sailing from Toulon towards Cadiz, had there been joined by
the Spanish fleet, and was steering for the West Indies. Nelson followed
with a much smaller number of ships, and might have forced an action in
those waters, but he was misled by false intelligence and missed the
enemy, though his dreaded presence was effectual in saving the British
islands from any serious attack.</p>

<p>The combined fleets of France and Spain recrossed the Atlantic and in
accordance with Napoleon's plans made for Ferrol on the coast of Galicia.
After being repulsed with some loss off Cape Finisterre by Sir Robert
Calder, who was court-martialled and severely reprimanded for neglecting
to follow up his victory, they put in first at Vigo, and then with fifteen
allied ships at Coru&ntilde;a. But, instead of venturing to carry out Napoleon's
orders by challenging Admiral Cornwallis's fleet off Brest, and making a
desperate effort to command the channel, Villeneuve now took advantage of
his emperors recommendation to return to Cadiz in event of defeat, and set
sail for that port in the middle of August. Nelson, ignorant of his
movements, had vainly sought him off the Straits of Gibraltar, and came
home to report himself at the admiralty. Arriving at Spithead on August
18, he was in England barely four weeks, most of which he spent in privacy
at Merton. During this brief respite he received a general tribute of
admiration and affection from his countrymen, which anticipated the
verdict of posterity. On September 15 he sailed from Portsmouth, with a
presentiment of his own fate, after having described to Sidmouth the
general design of his crowning sea fight: he would, he said, break the
enemy's line in two places; and he did so. He joined Admiral Collingwood
off Cadiz on the 29th, and on October 19 he received news that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
Villeneuve, smarting under the prospect of being superseded, had put to
sea with the combined fleet. Complicated naval man&oelig;uvres followed, but
on the 21st the enemy was forced to give battle, a few leagues from Cape
Trafalgar, and Nelson caused his immortal signal to be hoisted&mdash;"England
expects that every man will do his duty".</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE BATTLE OF TRAFALGAR.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_28" id="TOPIC_28"></a>The French and Spanish fleet comprised thirty-three ships of the line, of
which eighteen were French and fifteen Spanish; the British had only
twenty-seven, but among these were seven three-deckers as against four on
the side of the allies. It had the additional advantage of superior
discipline and equipment, to say nothing of the genius of its commander.
The British fleet advanced in two divisions, Nelson leading the weather
division of twelve, and Collingwood the lee division of fifteen ships.
According to Nelson's plan Collingwood was to attack the rear of the
enemy's line, while he himself cut off and paralysed the centre and van.
Both divisions advanced without regular formation, the ships bearing down
with all the speed they could command and without waiting for laggards.
Collingwood in the <i>Royal Sovereign</i>, steering E. by N., broke through the
allies' line twelve ships from the rear, raking the <i>Santa Ana</i>, Alava's
flagship, as he passed her stern, with a broadside which struck down 400
of her men. For some fifteen minutes the <i>Royal Sovereign</i> was alone in
action; then others of the division came up and successively penetrated
the line of the allies, and engaging ship to ship completely disposed of
the enemy's rear, their twelve rear ships being all taken or destroyed.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Nelson in the <i>Victory</i>, who had reserved to himself the more
difficult task of containing twenty-one ships with twelve, held on his
course, advancing so as to keep the allied van stationary and yet to
prevent the centre from venturing to help the rear. He designed to pass
through the end of the line in order to cut the enemy's van off from
Cadiz, but, finding an opportunity, changed his course, passed down the
line and attacked the centre. He passed through the line of the allied
fleet, closely followed by four other ships of his division, and the five
British ships concentrated their attacks on the <i>Bucentaure</i>, Villeneuve's
flagship, the gigantic Spanish four-decker, the <i>Sant&iacute;sima Trinidad</i>,
which was next ahead of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span> her, and the <i>Redoutable</i>, which supported her.
The centre of the allies was crushed and the van cut off from coming to
the help of the rear, which was being destroyed by Collingwood.</p>

<p>Before the battle ended, the naval force of France, and with it Napoleon's
projects of invasion, were utterly and hopelessly ruined. Eighteen prizes
were taken, and, though many of these were lost in a gale, four ships
which escaped were afterwards captured, and the remainder lay for the most
part shattered hulks at Cadiz. By this battle the supremacy of Great
Britain at sea was finally established. Nelson, who, during the
ship-to-ship engagement which followed his penetration of the enemy's
line, was mortally wounded by a sharp-shooter from the mizzen-top of the
<i>Redoutable</i>, died before the battle was over, though he was spared to
hear that a complete victory was secure. His death is among the heroic
incidents of history, and his last achievement, both in its conception and
its results, was the fitting climax of his fame. The plan for the battle
which he drew up beforehand for the instruction of his captains, and the
changes which he made in it to meet the conditions of the moment are alike
worthy of his supreme genius as a naval tactician. His arrangements were
carried out by men who had learned to love and trust him, and who were
inspired by the fire of his spirit, and hence it was that the allied fleet
of France and Spain perished at the "Nelson touch".<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_29" id="TOPIC_29"></a>Very different were the fortunes of war in central Europe, where Napoleon
himself commanded the "army of England". It was not until the end of
August that Napoleon knew that Villeneuve would be unable to appear in the
Channel, but no sooner did he abandon his project of invasion in despair
than he resolved on a campaign scarcely less arduous, and gave orders for
a grand march into Germany. Pitt, as we have seen, had successfully
negotiated an alliance with Russia and Austria, whose armies were
converging upon the plains of Bavaria and were to have been reinforced by
a large Prussian contingent. Unhappily, they had not effected a junction
when Napoleon crossed the Rhine near Strassburg and the Danube near
Donauw&ouml;rth, while he detached large forces to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span> check the advance of the
Russians and the approach of reinforcements expected from Italy. One of
these movements involved an open violation of Prussian territory, but he
could rely on the well-tried servility of Frederick William. The first
decisive result of his strategy was the surrender of Mack at Ulm, with
30,000 men and 60 pieces of ordnance. This event took place on October 20,
the very day before the battle of Trafalgar, and opened the road to
Vienna, which the French troops entered on November 13, occupying the
great bridge by a ruse more skilful than honourable, during the
negotiation of an armistice. Vienna was spared, while Napoleon pressed on
to meet the remainder of the Austrian army, which had now been joined by a
larger body of Russians near Br&uuml;nn. The allies numbered about 100,000 men;
Napoleon's army was numerically somewhat less, but possessed the same kind
of superiority as the British navy at Trafalgar. <a name="TOPIC_30" id="TOPIC_30"></a>The result was the
crushing victory of Austerlitz on December 2, followed by the peace of
Pressburg, between France and Austria, signed on the 26th. The principal
articles of this treaty provided for the cession of Venetia, Istria, and
Dalmatia to the kingdom of Italy, and the aggrandisement of Bavaria and
W&uuml;rtemberg, whose electors received the royal title as the price of their
sympathetic alliance with France. Russia withdrew sullenly, having learned
the hollowness of her league with Prussia, which had basely temporised
while the fate of Germany was at stake, and whose minister, Haugwitz,
suppressing the <i>ultimatum</i> which he was charged to deliver, had openly
congratulated the conqueror of Austerlitz.</p>

<p>Great Britain had had no direct share in the conflict in Southern Germany
and Moravia; she had, however, joined in two expeditions, the one in
Southern, the other in Northern Europe. In spite of a treaty of neutrality
between France and the Two Sicilies, ratified on October 8, an
Anglo-Russian squadron was permitted to land a force of 10,000 British
troops under Sir James Craig, and 14,000 Russians on the shore of the Bay
of Naples. These troops effected nothing, and the violation of neutrality
was, as we shall see, destined to involve the Neapolitan monarchy in ruin.
The expedition to North Germany was planned on a larger scale. Hanover had
been occupied by France since June, 1803. Its recovery was at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>tempted by
an Anglo-Hanoverian force under Cathcart, which was to have been supported
by a Russian and Swedish force acting from Stralsund. The co-operation of
Prussia was also expected. In order to secure this alliance the British
government offered Prussia an extension of territory so as to include
Antwerp, Li&egrave;ge, Luxemburg, and Cologne, in the event of victory. In
November the expedition landed. In December Prussia had definitely given
her protection to the Russian troops in Hanover and offered it to the
Hanoverians. Pitt computed that at the beginning of the next campaign
nearly 300,000 men would be available in North Germany. <a name="TOPIC_31" id="TOPIC_31"></a>But the
vacillation of Prussia ruined all. On December 15 Haugwitz signed the
treaty of Sch&ouml;nbrunn, by which Prussia was to enter into an offensive and
defensive alliance with France and was to receive Hanover in return for
Ansbach, Cleves, and Neuch&acirc;tel. Frederick William could not yet stoop to
such a degree of infamy, and therefore, instead of ratifying the treaty,
resolved on January 3, 1806, to propose a compromise, which involved among
other provisions the temporary occupation of Hanover by Prussia. In
consequence of this determination he sent, on January 7, a request for the
withdrawal of the British forces, which were accordingly recalled.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE DEATH OF PITT.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_32" id="TOPIC_32"></a>The collapse of his last coalition was the death-blow of Pitt, cheered
though he was for the moment by the news of Trafalgar. The fatal
consequences of Austerlitz were reported to him at Bath, whence he
returned by easy stages to his villa at Putney in January, 1806. His noble
spirit was broken at last by the defection of Prussia, and after lingering
a while, he died on the 23rd of that month, leaving a name second to none
among the greatest statesmen of his country. His sagacious mind grasped
the advantage to be gained by freeing trade from unnecessary restrictions,
and anticipated catholic emancipation, parliamentary reform, and the
abolition of slavery. He gave the nation, in the union with Ireland, the
one constructive measure of the first order achieved in his time, and only
marred by the weakness of more pliable successors in a lesser age. His
dauntless soul, which bore him up against the bitterest disappointments,
the desertion of friends, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span> depression of mortal disease, inspired
the governing classes of England to endure ten more years of exhausting
war, to save Europe (as he foretold) by their example, and to crown his
own work at Waterloo. His lofty eloquence, which has been described as a
gift independent of statesmanship, was indeed a product of statesmanship,
for it consisted in no mere witchery of words, but in a luminous and
convincing presentation of essential facts. He may have been inferior to
his own father in fiery rhetoric, to Peel in comprehensive grasp of
domestic policy, and to Gladstone in the political experience gained by
sixty years of political life, but in capacity for command he was inferior
to none. If he was not an ideal war minister, he was not a war minister by
his own choice; his lot was cast in times which suppressed the exercise of
his best powers; and he was matched in the organisation of war, though not
in the field, against the greatest organising genius known to history. He
must be judged by what he actually did and meditated as a peace minister;
his conduct of the war must be compared with that of those able but not
gifted men who strove to bend the bow which he left behind him; and we
must assuredly conclude that none of his colleagues or rivals was his peer
either in powers or in public spirit.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h3>GRENVILLE AND PORTLAND.</h3>


<p><a name="TOPIC_33" id="TOPIC_33"></a>The immediate effect of Pitt's death was the dissolution of his
government. The king turned at first to Hawkesbury, afterwards destined as
Earl of Liverpool to hold the office of premier for nearly fifteen years;
but he then felt himself unequal to such a burden. He next sent for
Grenville, who insisted on the co-operation of Fox, to which the king
assented without demur, and the short-lived ministry of "All the Talents"
was formed within a few days. It was essentially a whig cabinet, but it
included two tories, Sidmouth as lord privy seal, and Lord Ellenborough,
the lord chief justice. Grenville himself was first lord of the treasury,
Fox foreign secretary, and Erskine lord chancellor. Charles Grey, the
future Earl Grey, was first lord of the admiralty. Spencer home secretary,
Windham secretary for war and the colonies, and Lord Henry Petty, the
future Marquis of Lansdowne, chancellor of the exchequer. Fitzwilliam was
lord president, and the Earl of Moira master-general of the ordnance.
Ellenborough owed his place in the cabinet to the influence of Sidmouth.
The appointment was a departure from the established constitutional
practice. Since Lord Mansfield, who had ceased to be an efficient member
in 1765, no chief justice had been a member of the cabinet, and it was
argued in parliament by the opposition that a seat in the cabinet was
inconsistent with the independence which a common law judge ought to
maintain. It is also important to observe that Sidmouth when accepting
office gave express notice to Grenville and Fox that under all
circumstances "he would ever resist the catholic question".<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_34" id="TOPIC_34"></a>The friendly relations of the king with Fox were creditable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span> to both of
them, and in the last few months of his life Fox showed himself a
statesman. Besides the abolition of the slave trade, his grand object was
the restoration of peace on a durable basis. There were some grounds for
believing that this was possible. France, under an emperor, seemed no
longer to represent a new principle in European politics, and was not
necessarily a menace to her neighbours; the coalition was fairly beaten on
land, while British supremacy had been reasserted on sea, and Napoleon
might well wish for peace to enable him to consolidate his position on
land and regain the power of using the sea, just as he had done in 1801.
Fox lost no time in renewing a pacific correspondence with Talleyrand,
afterwards carried on through the agency of Lord Yarmouth, an English
traveller detained in France, and Lord Lauderdale, who was sent over as
plenipotentiary. The principle of the negotiation was that of <i>uti
possidetis</i>, but it failed, as Whitworth's efforts had failed, because the
pretensions of France were constantly shifting, and especially because
France, anxious to isolate Great Britain, insisted on negotiating
separately with Great Britain and Russia, while Fox very properly refused
to make peace without our ally. Grey himself, now Lord Howick, afterwards
declared that France showed no disposition to grant any terms which could
be accepted by Great Britain. On September 13, Fox died, and was buried in
Westminster Abbey almost side by side with his great rival.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_35" id="TOPIC_35"></a>While he was earnestly striving for peace, there was no cessation of
warlike movements or political changes either in Central Europe or in
Italy. In June, 1806, Napoleon converted the Batavian Republic into the
kingdom of Holland, over which he set his brother Louis. In July the
discord of Germany, which had long ceased to be a nation, was consummated
by the formation of the Confederation of the Rhine, which separated all
the western states from the Holy Roman empire, and united them under the
protection and control of France. On August 6, Francis II., who had
assumed the title of Emperor of Austria in 1804, formally renounced the
title of Roman Emperor, and the Holy Roman Empire became extinct. The King
of Prussia, with singular disregard of good faith and national interest,
finally accepted on February 15 the bribe of Hanover for adhesion to
France, but without the offensive and defensive alliance offered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span> him in
the previous December, and with the additional humiliation of being
compelled to close his ports to English ships. He vainly strove to conceal
this shameful bargain, and was, as will be seen, punished by the
destruction of Prussian commerce. After all, he found himself overreached
by Napoleon in duplicity, and was at last provoked into risking a
single-handed contest with his imperious ally. He declared war on October
1, and within a fortnight the army of Prussia, inheriting the system and
traditions of the great Frederick, was all but annihilated in the twin
battles of Jena and Auerst&auml;dt fought on October 14.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>SMALL EXPEDITIONS.</i></div>

<p>The British government, though not unwilling to forgive the perfidy of its
former confederate, was powerless to strike a blow on his behalf until it
was too late. Indeed, the only warlike operation undertaken by Great
Britain in Europe during the year was in the extreme south of Italy.
Ferdinand, King of the Two Sicilies, had been driven out of his capital to
make way for Joseph Bonaparte, who entered Naples on February 15, and the
exiled monarch took refuge in the island of Sicily. In accordance with the
shortsighted policy of small expeditions, a British force under Sir John
Stuart was landed in Calabria to raise the peasantry, and on July 4,
defeated the French at the point of the bayonet in the battle of Maida.
This action shook the confidence of Europe in the superiority of the
French infantry, and saved Sicily from France, but the French troops
remained in possession of the Italian mainland. The prestige of Great
Britain was raised by the conquest of the Dutch colony of the Cape of Good
Hope in January by a naval and military force sent out by Pitt under the
command of Sir Home Popham and General, now Sir David, Baird, but was
damaged by a futile expedition to South America, undertaken by Popham
without orders from the home government. The city of Buenos Ayres was
taken, indeed, in June by General Beresford, but it was retaken by the
Spaniards in August, and soldiers who could ill be spared from the
European conflict now impending were lavished on a chimerical project on
the other side of the Atlantic.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_36" id="TOPIC_36"></a>The short administration of Grenville, so inactive in its foreign policy,
is memorable only for one redeeming measure of home-policy&mdash;the abolition
of the slave trade. Before Fox's death, the attention of parliament had
been divided mainly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span> between Windham's abortive scheme for a vast standing
army, to be raised on the basis of limited service, and the secret inquiry
into the conduct of the Princess of Wales. This resulted in her being
acquitted of the more scandalous charges against her, but on the advice of
the cabinet, she was censured by the king for unseemly levity of
behaviour. On October 24 parliament was dissolved. It was a foolish
dissolution, for ministerial convenience only, and aimed not merely at
strengthening the ministry, but at weakening the tory section within the
ministry. The election was not well managed, and the king withheld the
subscription of &pound;12,000 with which he was accustomed to assist his
ministers for the time being at a general election. <a name="TOPIC_37" id="TOPIC_37"></a>Still the ministry
obtained a considerable majority.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> The new parliament met on December
15, and on March 25, 1807, the abolition bill, having passed the house of
lords in spite of strong opposition, was carried in the commons by 283 to
16. Thus ended a philanthropic struggle, which began in 1783, when the
quakers petitioned against the trade. Three years later Clarkson began his
crusade. Two bills in favour of abolition were carried by the house of
commons before the close of the eighteenth century, but were thrown out in
the house of lords. The same fate befell a bill for a temporary suspension
of the slave trade, which passed the commons in 1804 under the spell of
Wilberforce's persuasive eloquence; but Pitt's government caused a royal
proclamation to be issued, which at least checked the spread of the
nefarious traffic in the newly conquered colonies. A larger measure failed
to pass the house of commons in 1805, but in 1806 Fox and Grenville
succeeded in committing both houses to an open condemnation of the trade.
This was followed on March 25, 1807, by an enactment entirely prohibiting
the slave trade from and after January 1, 1808, though it was not made
felony to engage in it until a further act was carried by Brougham in
1811.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>FALL OF GRENVILLE'S MINISTRY.</i></div>

<p>In default of important legislative tasks, the parliament which expired in
1806 devoted much attention to various features of the military system, as
well as to proposed reforms in the public accounts. It sanctioned the
principle of raising a great part of the war-expenses by special taxes
rather than by loan. A property-tax of 10 per cent. was freely voted, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
this was then represented to be its permanent limit. The assessed taxes
were increased at the same time by 10 per cent., but with an allowance in
favour of poorer taxpayers for every child above the number of two. It is
worthy of notice that, while Grenville's ministry was in office, Whitbread
brought forward an elaborate plan not only for reforming the poor laws but
also for establishing a system of national education. Some changes in the
cabinet were necessitated by the death of Fox. Howick became foreign
secretary and was succeeded at the admiralty by Thomas Grenville, brother
of the prime minister, most famous as a book-collector. Fitzwilliam
retired at the same time on the ground of ill-health. He retained his seat
in the cabinet, but was succeeded as lord president by Sidmouth, while
Fox's nephew, Lord Holland, succeeded Sidmouth as lord privy seal.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_38" id="TOPIC_38"></a>The fall of the whig government in March, 1807, was due to a cause similar
to that which had brought about the retirement of Pitt in 1801. The Duke
of Bedford, who was lord lieutenant of Ireland, had urged the importance
of making some concessions to Roman catholics. An Irish act of 1793 had
opened commissions in the army as high as the rank of colonel to Roman
catholics, and the ministry obtained the reluctant consent of the king to
the extension of this concession to Roman catholics throughout his
dominions. Without having fully ascertained the king's mind, Howick, on
behalf of his colleagues, moved for leave to bring in a bill opening all
commissions in the army and navy to Roman catholics. The king at once
refused his sanction, and the government, finding that they could not
carry their bill, agreed to withdraw it. This decision was announced to
the king in a cabinet minute, drawn up at a meeting from which
Ellenborough, Erskine, and Sidmouth, who sympathised with the king, were
excluded, and from which Fitzwilliam and Spencer were absent owing to
ill-health. The minute went on to record their adhesion to the policy
embodied in the bill, reserving the right to advise the king on any future
occasion in accordance with that policy. Thereupon, Sidmouth, who had
already sent in his resignation, Eldon, Portland, and Malmesbury, with the
concurrence of the Duke of York and Spencer Perceval, urged the king to
make a stand upon his prerogative. He did so, by requiring<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span> the ministers
who had signed the minute, to give him a written pledge that they would
never press upon him further concessions, direct or indirect, to the Roman
catholics. This pledge they properly declined, and accepted the
consequence by resignation. Spencer was present at the meeting which
arrived at this conclusion and concurred in the decision of his
colleagues.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_39" id="TOPIC_39"></a>A new administration was formed by Portland, as nominal head, but with
Perceval as its real leader and chancellor of the exchequer, Canning as
foreign secretary, Hawkesbury as home secretary, and Castlereagh as
minister for war and the colonies. Camden, Eldon, Westmorland, and Chatham
resumed the offices they had held before the death of Pitt, Mulgrave
became first lord of the admiralty, and Earl Bathurst president of the
board of trade. In this government, too, Sir Arthur Wellesley, the future
Duke of Wellington, who had returned in 1805 from a brilliant military
career in India, held office outside the cabinet as chief secretary for
Ireland. Spencer Perceval was a half-brother of the Earl of Egmont and
brother of Lord Arden. He enjoyed a large practice at the bar and had made
his mark as a parliamentary debater when filling the offices, first of
solicitor-general, and then of attorney-general under Addington. He had
held the latter office again under Pitt. Not the least source of his
influence was his steady and determined opposition to the Roman catholic
claims.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>NON-INTERVENTION.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_40" id="TOPIC_40"></a>After a short but animated debate on the important constitutional question
raised by the circumstances of the change of ministers, parliament was
again dissolved on April 27. The king's speech in closing the session was
virtually a personal appeal to his people, and a majority was returned in
favour of the new ministry. This result may be said to mark the last
triumph of George III. in maintaining the principle of personal
government. "A just and enlightened toleration" was announced as the
substitute for catholic relief. Still, a certain revival of independent
popular opinion may be traced in the return of Sir<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span> Francis Burdett and
Lord Cochrane for Westminster. It was not until June 22 that parliament
assembled, and the engrossing interest of foreign events left but little
room for discussions on home-policy. A motion by Whitbread, however, bore
fruit in a bill for establishing parochial schools, which Eldon
successfully opposed in the house of lords, mainly on the ground that it
would take popular education out of the hands of the clergy. The same not
unnatural apathy about home affairs prevailed throughout the session of
1808, which began on January 31, and though a large number of acts were
placed on the statute book in this and succeeding years, the mass of them,
including many relating to Ireland, were essentially of a local or
occasional character. An exception must be recognised in the partial
success of a motion for the reform of the criminal law, which was proposed
by Sir Samuel Romilly, famous for his efforts in the cause of humanity,
and which resulted in the abolition of capital punishment for the offence
of pocket-picking.</p>

<p>During this critical period, when Great Britain was gradually drifting
into a position of isolation, the course of parliamentary history becomes
inseparable from the progress of those mighty events on the continent,
which Grenville's government would fain have treated as outside the sphere
of British interests. For, notwithstanding Windham's schemes for a
reconstruction of the army, that government had allowed the naval and
military establishments of Great Britain to fall below their former
standard. The leading idea of their policy was non-intervention, and at
the opening of 1807, there was no longer any thought of sending a force to
cope with Napoleon's veterans on the continent When in 1805 a British
force was operating in North Germany, it was possible that if Prussia had
been faithful to her engagements, the disaster of Austerlitz might at
least have been partially retrieved. It was otherwise when, after the
collapse of Prussia, France and Russia stood face to face with each other.
The drawn battle of Eylau in East Prussia, marked by fearful carnage, was
fought on February 8, 1807. This check, breaking the spell of Napoleon's
victorious career, had a remarkable effect in raising the spirits of the
allies, Russia, Sweden, and Prussia, some remains of whose army were still
in the field. These powers now drew closer together, but they received a
lukewarm support from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span> Great Britain, which might have done much to save
Europe by timely reinforcements and liberal subsidies. In reply to an
urgent appeal from the tsar for a loan of &pound;6,000,000, the Grenville
ministry doled out &pound;500,000 to Russia, and a still more pitiful gift to
Prussia. No troops were sent to aid Sweden on the Baltic coast, although,
when, at Napoleon's instigation, Turkey declared war against Russia,
expeditions were despatched to Alexandria and the Dardanelles. The notion
of making war on a large scale, in concert with allies, on the continent
of Europe, as in the days of Marlborough, and even of Lord Granby, seems
to have vanished from the minds of English statesmen, except Castlereagh,
who always advocated concentrated action.</p>

<p>The succession of Portland and Canning to Grenville and Howick brought no
immediate change in our insular policy and the new government had been in
office for above three months before a British force at last appeared in
the Swedish island of R&uuml;gen. It arrived too late, Danzig surrendered in
May, and on June 14 Napoleon obtained a decisive victory over the Russian
army and its Prussian contingent at Friedland. Russia now gave a supreme
example of that national selfishness, and contempt for the rights of
independent states which had dominated the counsels of sovereigns ever
since the first partition of Poland. Doubtless the tsar might plead that
Great Britain, too, had been wasting her strength in selfish attempts to
secure her mastery of the seas, and to open new markets for her trade. He
also deeply resented her recent failure to aid him in the hour of his
utmost need, while he still cherished the policy of the "armed
neutrality," and was eager to prosecute his designs against Turkey.
Dazzled and flattered by Napoleon, he welcomed overtures for peace at the
expense of Great Britain, and there is no doubt that his imaginative
nature indulged in the vision of a regenerated Europe, divided between
himself as emperor of the east and Napoleon as emperor of the west. It is
therefore far from surprising that he should have held a private interview
with Napoleon, on a raft in the Niemen, which led to the treaty of Tilsit
on July 7.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE TREATY OF TILSIT.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_41" id="TOPIC_41"></a>This treaty, in which the King of Prussia shared as a helpless partner,
contained both public and secret articles, but the distinction was not
very material, for the secret articles almost<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span> immediately became known to
Canning. The general effect of the whole agreement was the utter
humiliation of Prussia, the recognition by that country and Russia of all
Napoleon's acquisitions, and their combination with France against the
maritime claims and conquests of Great Britain. The western provinces of
Prussia were to be incorporated with other German annexations to form the
new kingdom of Westphalia; Prussian Poland was to be converted into the
duchy of Warsaw under the crown of Saxony, to which a right of passage
through Silesia was reserved; and Berlin with other great Prussian
fortresses were to remain in the hands of the French until an exorbitant
war indemnity should have been paid.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> At one stroke Prussia was thus
reduced to a second-rate power, with a territory little greater than it
possessed before the first partition of Poland. The rule of Joseph
Bonaparte at Naples, that of Louis in Holland, and the confederation of
the Rhine, were solemnly confirmed. Above all, Russia pledged herself to
join France in coercing Sweden, Denmark, and Portugal into an adoption of
the organised commercial exclusion, known as the "continental system," and
hostility to Great Britain in the event of her resistance. If Sweden
refused to join this league, Denmark was to be compelled to declare war on
her.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_42" id="TOPIC_42"></a>No sooner did it receive information of this alliance than the British
government despatched a naval armament to Denmark and landed troops, which
were soon reinforced by those withdrawn from R&uuml;gen. There had been no open
rupture with Denmark, though much irritation existed between Denmark and
Great Britain with reference to neutral commerce. But there were the best
reasons for believing that the Danish fleet, as well as that of Portugal,
would be demanded by France and Russia, to be employed against Great
Britain, and it was certain that Denmark could not withstand such
pressure. The British envoy, Jackson, was accordingly instructed to offer
Denmark a treaty of alliance, of which one condition was to be the deposit
of her fleet on hire with the British government. The proposal was
accompanied by a threat of force, and the crown prince, with a spirit
worthy of admiration, refused the terms. In consequence a peremptory<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
summons to deliver up her ships of war and naval stores was addressed to
the governor of Copenhagen by the British commanders, Admiral Gambier and
Lord Cathcart, under whom Sir Arthur Wellesley was entrusted with the
reserve. The surrender, if made peaceably, was to be in the nature of a
deposit, and the fleet was to be restored at the end of the war. The
governor returned a temporising reply, and a bombardment of Copenhagen
followed (September 2); the fleet was brought to England as prize of war;
and Denmark naturally became the enemy of Great Britain.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> Sweden
declined the proffered alliance of France and Russia, and actually invaded
Norway, then a part of the Danish kingdom. The result was the loss of
Finland and Swedish Pomerania. The king, Gustavus IV., resembled Charles
XII. in quixotic temperament, but not in ability; and Sir John Moore, sent
to his support with an army of 10,000 men, found it hopeless to co-operate
with him. Shortly afterwards, his subjects formed the same opinion, and he
was compelled to make way for his uncle, who succeeded as Charles XIII.
with Marshal Bernadotte as crown prince. In consequence of this change
Sweden became reconciled to Russia, and estranged from Great Britain.</p>

<p>The seizure of the Danish fleet, in time of so-called peace, roused great
indignation throughout most of Europe, and, in some degree, strained the
conscience of the British parliament itself. The justice and wisdom of it
were strenuously challenged in both houses, especially by Grenville,
Sidmouth, and Lord Darnley, who moved an address to the crown embodying an
impressive protest against it. It was defended, however, by the high
authority of the Marquis Wellesley, as well as by Canning and other
ministers, on the simple ground of military necessity. Napoleon himself
never ceased to denounce it as an international outrage of the highest
enormity. This did not prevent his doing his best to justify it and to
imitate it by sending Junot's expedition to Portugal, with instructions to
seize the Portuguese fleet at Lisbon. It is strange that in the debates on
this subject, peace with France was still treated on both sides as a
possibility; but Canning declared that neither Russian nor Austrian
mediation could have been accepted as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span> impartial, or as affording the
least hope of pacification. However, on September 25, the king addressed a
declaration to Europe, in which, after justifying himself in regard to
Copenhagen, he professed his readiness to accept conditions of peace
"consistent with the maritime rights and political existence of Great
Britain".</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>COMMERCIAL EXCLUSION.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_43" id="TOPIC_43"></a>Still more reasonable attacks, supported by strong petitions, were made by
the opposition upon the "orders in council," whereby the British
government retaliated against Napoleon's "continental system". This system
was founded on a firm belief, shared by the French people, that Great
Britain, as mistress of the seas, was the one great obstacle to his
imperial ambition, and the most formidable enemy of French aggrandisement,
only to be crushed by the ruin of her trade. Prussia had, in conformity
with her treaty of February 15, 1806, issued a proclamation on March 28 of
that year, closing her ports, which would now include those of Hanover,
against British trade. The British government replied by first laying an
embargo on Prussian vessels in the harbours of Great Britain and Ireland,
and by proclaiming a blockade of the coast of Europe from Brest to the
Elbe. This was followed on May 14 by an order in council for seizing all
vessels found navigating under Prussian colours. As yet the policy of
commercial exclusion had not been carried to any great length, but the
Berlin decree issued by Napoleon on November 21 after the battle of Jena
proclaimed the whole of the British Isles to be in a state of blockade,
prohibited all commerce with them from the ports of France and her
dependent states, confiscated all British merchandise in such ports, and
declared all British subjects in countries occupied by French troops to be
prisoners of war. Howick replied by further orders in council in January,
1807, forbidding neutrals to trade between the ports of France and her
allies, or between the ports of nations which should observe the Berlin
decree, on pain of the confiscation of the ship and cargo. On the 27th
another decree, issued at Warsaw, ordered the seizure in the Hanse Towns
of all British goods and colonial produce. The reply of Great Britain was
a stricter blockade of the North German coast.</p>

<p>The accession of Russia to Napoleon's commercial policy at Tilsit seemed
to have brought the combination against British<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span> trade to its furthest
development, and it was answered by new orders in council, treating any
port from which the British flag was excluded as if actually blockaded,
and further limiting the carriage by neutral vessels of produce from
hostile colonies. The Milan decree issued on December 17, and further
orders in council published during the same winter, carried to greater
extremes, if possible, this intolerable form of commercial warfare, under
which neutral commerce was gradually crushed out of existence. Great
Britain, owing to her command of the sea, was more independent of this
kind of commerce than her rival, and both the decrees and the orders in
council inflicted far more damage on France and her allies than on Great
Britain. But neither party was able to enforce completely its policy of
commercial exclusion. Europe could not dispense with British goods or
colonial produce carried in British vessels. The law was deliberately set
aside by a regular licensing system, and evaded by wholesale smuggling;
neutral ships continued to ply between continental ports, and Napoleon did
not disdain to clothe his troops with 50,000 British overcoats during the
Eylau campaign. Still, Great Britain was enabled to cripple, if not to
destroy, the merchant shipping of all other countries, and the interests
of consumers all over Europe were enlisted against the author of the
continental system. On the other hand, a heavy blow was dealt to friendly
relations between Great Britain and the United States, the chief victim of
these belligerent pretensions.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>FRUITLESS EXPEDITIONS.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_44" id="TOPIC_44"></a>In the meantime, the prestige of Great Britain had been injured by three
petty and abortive expeditions projected by the Grenville ministry. The
first of these was sent out to complete the conquest of Buenos Ayres, the
recapture of which was unknown in England. Sir Samuel Auchmuty, who
commanded it, finding himself too late to occupy that city, attacked and
took Monte Video by storm with much skill and spirit, on February 3, 1807.
Shortly afterwards, he was superseded by General Whitelocke, bringing
reinforcements, with orders to recover Buenos Ayres. In this he signally
failed, owing to gross tactical errors. The British troops were almost
passively<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span> slaughtered in the streets, and Whitelocke agreed to withdraw
the remains of his force, and give up Monte Video, on condition of all
prisoners being surrendered. On his return home, he was tried by a
court-martial and cashiered, being also declared "totally unfit to serve
his majesty in any military capacity whatever".</p>

<p>Equally ill-managed was the naval expedition, directed to support Russia,
then in close alliance with Great Britain, by coercing the sultan into a
rupture with France. Collingwood, who was not consulted, was required to
entrust the command of this expedition, which started in February, 1807,
to Sir John Duckworth. Everything depended on promptitude, and the admiral
found little difficulty in forcing the passage of the Dardanelles, as it
was then almost unfortified. Having reached Constantinople, he allowed
himself to waste time in fruitless negotiations, contrary to Collingwood's
earnest advice, and not only effected nothing but gravely imperilled his
return. Instructed by the French minister S&eacute;bastiani, the Turks had armed
their coasts, and erected batteries along the Dardanelles, through which
the British fleet made its way with considerable loss. Instead of being
detached from the French alliance, the Porte was thrown into its arms and
became more embittered than ever against Russia. It was soon involved in a
serious conflict with that country&mdash;for the possession of Wallachia and
Moldavia&mdash;only to be deserted again by France under the compact made at
Tilsit. The expedition to Egypt, planned in combination with the
expedition to the Dardanelles, ended in a still worse disaster. Though
General Fraser, its commander, was able to surprise Alexandria on March
30, he awaited in vain the expected news of Duckworth's success; he
proceeded to attack Rosetta with as little generalship as Whitelocke had
shown at Buenos Ayres, and encountered a similar repulse. An attempt to
besiege the town met with no better fortune: the British troops submitted
to a capitulation, evacuated Egypt, and sailed for Sicily in September,
1807. In an imperial manifesto addressed to the French nation at the end
of this year, the British failures at Buenos Ayres, Constantinople, and
Alexandria were paraded, together with our alleged crime against the
rights of nations at Copenhagen.</p>

<p>In the early months of 1808 the continental system was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span> extended by the
establishment of French administration at Rome, and the annexation of the
eastern ports of the Papal States to the kingdom of Italy. On February 18
of the same year Austria under French pressure adopted the system. Sweden
and Turkey were now the only continental countries left outside it, but
the retention of Sicily by the Bourbon king rendered it easy for British
commerce to enter Italy through that island. The irritation of neutrals
increased as the area of commercial exclusion widened, but the United
States were now the only neutral power of any consequence. After April 17
Napoleon took the high-handed step of confiscating all American shipping
in his ports. In spite of this aggression, the president and congress of
the United States continued to favour France against Great Britain. The
story of the commercial warfare between Great Britain and the United
States will be related more fully hereafter. For the present, it is
sufficient to mention that an act, placing an embargo on foreign vessels
in American ports, was passed by congress on December 22, 1807, and
another on March 1, 1809, forbidding commercial intercourse with Great
Britain and France and the colonies occupied by them.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Great Britain continued to enforce her maritime rights,
including that of searching American merchantmen for British-born sailors,
and impressing them at the will of British naval officers. These
grievances ultimately led to a war between Great Britain and America in
1812. The continental system, however, did not long remain so complete as
in the beginning of 1808. Junot's expedition to Portugal had led to a
French occupation of that country before the end of 1807. The conquest of
Portugal was followed, as we shall see later, by a partial conquest of
Spain. This threw the Spaniards back upon the British alliance and
afforded an opportunity for the liberation of Portugal, so that from May,
1808, Great Britain once more had a large seaboard open to her commerce.
The early success of the Spanish resistance to France, and other events in
the peninsula hereafter to be recorded, encouraged Austria to arm again;
and on the news of the capitulation of the French army at Baylen in July,
she pushed forward her preparations with redoubled energy. A national
movement arose simultaneously in North Germany,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span> but the Prussian
government dared not head it so long as Russia remained faithful to the
French alliance.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>NAPOLEON AT ERFURT.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_45" id="TOPIC_45"></a>Notwithstanding a peremptory declaration from the tsar after the seizure
of the Danish fleet, Russia had nothing to gain by war with Great Britain.
She was bound to France by the prospect held forth to her at Tilsit of the
conquest of Finland and the partition of Turkey, but she was inwardly
desirous of peace with Great Britain. Napoleon, on the other hand, saw in
the partition of Turkey an opportunity of striking at India, and had
actually given orders for naval preparations to be made in Spain, when all
thought of eastern conquest had to be postponed owing to the success of
the Spanish patriots. After a conference between Napoleon and the tsar at
Erfurt a secret convention was signed on October 12, by which France
sanctioned Russian conquests in Finland and the Danubian provinces, and
Russia recognised the Bonaparte dynasty in Spain and promised to assist
France in a defensive war against Austria. The two powers despatched a
joint note to Great Britain inviting her to make peace, on the principle
of <i>uti possidetis</i>. Canning replied that he was prepared to negotiate if
his allies, especially Sweden and the Spanish patriots, who were at that
time in actual possession of almost the entire country, were included in
the peace. On November 19 Napoleon expressed his willingness to treat with
the British allies, but not with the Spanish "rebels," as he styled them.
Alexander took up a similar position, speaking of the Spanish
"insurgents," and expressly recognising Joseph as King of Spain. Thus
ended these pacific overtures, and on November 3 the official <i>expos&eacute;</i>,
annually issued in Paris, described Great Britain as "the enemy of the
world".</p>

<p>The year 1808 is memorable in English history for the active intervention
of Great Britain in the affairs of Spain which developed into the
"Peninsular war".<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> This intervention was rendered possible and
effective by the organisation of our army system in 1807, which was due to
Castlereagh, though he received little credit for it. Under this system,
the old constitutional force of the militia was made the basis of the
whole military establishment. By the militia balloting bill and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span> the
militia transfer bill, that force, largely composed of substitutes, and
bound only to home-service, was practically converted into a
recruiting-ground for the regular army, and proved sufficient to make good
all the losses incurred during the long campaigns in Portugal and Spain.
The army thus raised contained, no doubt, many soldiers of bad character,
whose misdeeds, after the furious excitement of an escalade, or under the
heart-breaking stress of a retreat, sometimes brought disgrace upon the
British name. But these men, side by side with steadier comrades, bore
themselves like heroes on many a bloodstained field; they quailed not
before the conquering legions of Austerlitz and Wagram; they could "go
anywhere or do anything" under trusted leaders; and they restored the
military reputation of their country before the eyes of Europe. To have
forged such an instrument of war was no mean administrative exploit. To
have maintained its efficiency steadily on the whole, though sometimes
with a faint-hearted parsimony, and to have loyally supported its
commander against the cavils of a factious opposition superior in
parliamentary ability, for a period of seven years, must be held to redeem
the tory government from the charge of political weakness.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>PARLIAMENTARY ZEAL.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_46" id="TOPIC_46"></a>At the beginning of 1809, however, the interest of parliament was less
concentrated on Sir Arthur Wellesley's first campaign in Portugal, or even
on the convention of Cintra, than on the scandals attaching to the office
of commander-in-chief, held by the Duke of York. Though an incapable
general, the duke had shown himself, on the whole, an excellent
administrator, and in the opinion of the best officers had done much for
the discipline and efficiency of the British army. Unfortunately, Mrs.
Clarke, his former mistress, had received bribes for using her influence
with the duke to procure military appointments. Colonel Wardle, an obscure
member of parliament, to whom Mrs. Clarke had temporarily transferred
herself after being discarded by the duke, animated by a desire to damage
the ministry, came forward with charges directly implicating him in her
corrupt practices, and incidentally brought similar accusations against
Portland and Eldon. The government foolishly agreed to an inquiry on the
Duke of York's behalf, and it was conducted before a committee of the
whole house, which sat from January 26 to March 20. In the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span> course of this
inquiry, Sir Arthur Wellesley bore strong testimony in his favour, and the
duke addressed a letter to the speaker, declaring his innocence of
corruption. Though Wardle and his associates pressed for his dismissal,
Perceval ultimately carried a motion acquitting him not only of corruption
but of connivance with corruption. The majority, however, was small, and
the duke thought it necessary to resign on March 20, whereupon the house
of commons decided to proceed no further. A curious sequel of this case
was an action against Wardle by an upholsterer, who had furnished a house
for Mrs. Clarke by Wardle's orders, in consideration of her services in
giving hostile evidence against her former protector. The plaintiff
obtained &pound;2,000 damages, and the law-suit was the means of producing a
reaction in popular feeling in favour of the duke.</p>

<p>This scandal in high places quickened the zeal of parliament for general
purity of administration, and led to a disclosure of some grave abuses.
One of these, connected with the disposal of captured Dutch property,
dated as far back as 1795. Others were found to exist in the navy
department and the distribution of Indian patronage; others related to
parliamentary elections. Perceval brought in a bill to check the sale and
brokerage of offices, nor did Castlereagh himself escape the charge of
having procured the election of Lord Clancarty to parliament by the offer
of an Indian writership to a borough-monger. A frank explanation saved him
from censure, especially as it appeared that the offer had never taken
effect. The charge was renewed, in a different form, against both him and
Perceval, and their accusers moved for a trial at bar. But as it turned
out that undue influence rather than corruption was their alleged offence,
and as the avowed object of the resolution was to force on parliamentary
reform, it was negatived by an immense majority. Nevertheless, the object
was not wholly defeated.</p>

<p>The removal of the Duke of York from the command of the army was
singularly inopportune, for Sir David Dundas had scarcely been appointed
as his successor when a juncture arose specially demanding a combination
of energy and experience. The British government, already engaged in the
Peninsular war, had at last resolved to take a vigorous part in the new
and desperate struggle between France and Austria in Southern Germany. The
latent spirit of German nationality,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span> aroused by Napoleon's ruthless
treatment of Prussia, and quickened into a flame by sympathy with the
uprising in Spain, was embodied in the secret association of the
<i>Tugendbund</i>; and Austria, smarting under a sense of her own humiliation,
mustered up courage to assume the leadership of a national movement. South
Germany, governed by old dynasties, which profited by the French alliance,
displayed as yet no symptoms of disaffection to France; but in North
Germany the old dynasties had been either humbled or deposed, and the
general ferment among the people, needed, as the Austrians believed, only
the presence of a regular army to break out into a national revolt against
the foreigner. Prussia, it is true, was still unwilling to move, because
Russia was hostile; but the Austrian court knew well the lukewarmness of
Russia's attachment to France, and hoped that a national upheaval would
carry the Prussian government along with it. No one, in fact, had played a
more active part in rousing Northern Germany than the Prussian minister,
Stein, whom Frederick William, by Napoleon's advice, had called to his
councils after Tilsit, and who was now compelled to resign his office and
take refuge in Austria.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>NAPOLEON IN AUSTRIA.</i></div>

<p>The British government was aware of the situation in Germany when it
received a request in January, 1809, for the despatch of a British force
to the mouth of the Elbe. Austria was, however, still nominally at war
with Great Britain, and George III., perhaps not unreasonably, refused to
give her active military assistance till peace was concluded. Meanwhile a
subsidy of &pound;250,000 in bullion was despatched to Trieste, and inquiries
were set on foot as to the means of supplying such a military expedition
as Austria desired.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> On March 22, Dundas, who had only been a few days
in office as commander-in-chief, reported that 15,000 men could not be
spared from home service, and, in consequence, no extensive preparations
were made until the muster rolls in June showed that 40,000 troops might
safely be employed abroad. This convinced the government that a large
force could be sent without interfering with home defence, as Castlereagh
had long contended; and throughout June and July the naval and military
departments were busy in preparing for what has since left a sinister
memory as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span> the Walcheren expedition. Meanwhile, as if the passion of
frittering away resources were irresistible, a smaller force was
despatched, as a kind of feint, against the kingdom of Naples. It
consisted of 15,000 British troops and a body of Sicilians. Bailing from
Palermo early in June it captured the islands of Ischia and Procida and
the castle of Scylla, and threw Naples into consternation. But the attack
was not pushed, and it was too late to be of any assistance to the
Austrians who had already been expelled from the Italian peninsula. At
last, in July, the treaty of peace with Austria was signed and the great
armament was ready to sail.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_47" id="TOPIC_47"></a>But Napoleon had not awaited the deliberations of British statesmen.
Hurrying back from Spain, he remained in Paris only long enough to
organise a campaign in South Germany, and left the capital to join his
armies on April 13. A week earlier, the Archduke Charles, having
remodelled the Austrian army, issued a proclamation affirming Austria to
be the champion of European liberty. On the 9th Austria declared war
against Bavaria, the ally of France, and her troops crossed the Inn. On
the 17th, when Napoleon arrived at Donauw&ouml;rth, he found the archduke in
occupation of Ratisbon. His presence turned the tide, and, after three
victories, he was once more on the road to Vienna. The most important of
these victories was that of Eckm&uuml;hl, and he regarded the man&oelig;uvre by
which it was won as the finest in his military career. On May 13 the
French entered Vienna, but the Archduke Charles with an army of nearly
200,000 men was facing him on the left bank of the Danube. Napoleon's army
crossed and encountered the Austrians on the great plain between Aspern
and Essling. He was repulsed and fell back upon Lobau, between which and
the Vienna side of the Danube the bridge of boats had been swept away by a
rise of the river and by balks of timber floated down by the Austrians. In
this dangerous position he remained shut up for several weeks. He finally
succeeded in throwing across a light bridge by which his army regained the
left bank on the night of July 4. Finding their position turned the
Austrians took up their stand on the tableland of Wagram. On July 6
another pitched battle was fought, which, in the number of combatants
engaged and in the losses inflicted on both sides, must rank with the
later conflicts of Borodino and Leipzig. A<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span> hard won victory rested with
the French, but it was not such a victory as that of Austerlitz or Jena,
though it secured the neutrality, at least, of Austria for the next four
years. Her army retreated into Bohemia, and on July 12 an armistice was
signed at Znaim in Moravia, which formed the basis of a peace concluded at
Vienna on October 14.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE WALCHEREN EXPEDITION.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_48" id="TOPIC_48"></a>Nothing remained for Great Britain but to abandon the auxiliary enterprise
so long planned, but so often delayed, or to carry it through
independently, with little hope of a decisive issue. The latter
alternative was adopted. The very day on which the news of the armistice
arrived witnessed the departure of the greatest single armament ever sent
out fully equipped from the shores of Great Britain. The deplorable
failure of the Walcheren expedition has obscured both its magnitude and
its probable importance had it only proved successful. The command of the
fleet was given to Sir Richard Strachan, a competent admiral; that of the
army to Chatham, who sat in the cabinet as master-general of the ordnance,
an incompetent general, who owed his nomination to royal favour. This was
the first blunder; the second was the utter neglect of medical and
sanitary precautions against the notoriously unhealthy climate of
Walcheren in the autumn months. The armament sailed from the Downs on July
28, in the finest weather and with a display of intense national
enthusiasm. It consisted of thirty-five ships of the line, with a swarm of
smaller war-vessels and transports, carrying nearly 40,000 troops, two
battering-trains, and a complete apparatus of military stores. Its
destination, though more than suspected by the enemy, had been officially
kept secret at home. Castlereagh must be held largely responsible for the
delays and for the unwise choice of a general which marred its success,
but he showed true military sagacity in designating the point of attack.
Inspired by him, the British government, distrusting the national movement
in North Germany, had decided to strike at Antwerp, which Napoleon had
supplied with new docks, and which, now that the mouth of the Scheldt had
been reopened, threatened to become the commercial rival of London. The
town was entirely unprepared, and a blow dealt here seemed the best way of
doing as much harm as possible to France and at the same time gaining a
national advantage for Great Britain.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>Chatham had received very precise instructions from Castlereagh, the
objects prescribed to him being, (1) the capture or destruction of the
enemy's ships, either building or afloat at Antwerp or Flushing, or afloat
in the Scheldt; (2) the destruction of the arsenals and dockyards at
Antwerp, Terneuze, and Flushing; (3) the reduction of the island of
Walcheren; (4) the rendering of the Scheldt no longer navigable to ships
of war. These objects were named, as far as possible, in the order of
their importance, and Chatham was specially directed to land troops at
Sandvliet and push on straight to Antwerp, with the view of taking it by a
<i>coup de main</i>. Napoleon, who clearly foretold the catastrophe awaiting
the British troops in the malarious swamps of Walcheren, afterwards
admitted that Antwerp could have been captured by a sudden assault.
Chatham obeyed his general orders, but, instead of taking them in the
order of importance, gave precedence to the objects which could most
easily be accomplished. By prompt action the French fleet, which was
moored off Flushing, might have been captured, but it was allowed to
escape to Antwerp. By August 2 the British were in complete possession of
the mouth of the Scheldt, and had taken Bath opposite Sandvliet, while
Antwerp was still almost unprotected. But Chatham concentrated his
attention on the siege of Flushing, which surrendered, after three days'
bombardment, on August 16, contrary to Napoleon's expectation. Antwerp had
meanwhile been put in a state of defence, and was now protected by the
enemy's fleet, while French and Dutch troops were pouring down to the
Scheldt. After ten days of inactivity, Chatham advanced his headquarters
to Bath, found that further advance was impossible, and recommended the
government to recall the expedition, leaving 15,000 men to defend the
island of Walcheren. This advice was adopted, but the garrison left in
Walcheren suffered most severely from fever in that swampy island.
Eventually, on December 24, Walcheren was abandoned, the works and naval
basins of Flushing having been previously destroyed. The destruction of
Flushing was the sole result of this expedition.</p>

<p>The failure of the British to make any serious impression on the French
either in the Low Countries or in Spain induced Austria to consent to
peace with France. By the peace<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span> of Vienna, signed on October 14, she
ceded Salzburg and a part of Upper Austria to Bavaria, West Galicia to the
duchy of Warsaw, and a part of Carinthia with Trieste and the Illyrian
provinces to France. A small strip of Galicia was ceded to the Russian
tsar, who had rendered France some very half-hearted assistance and was
further alienated by the extension of the duchy of Warsaw. Austria was
enslaved to the will of Napoleon. She had abandoned the Tyrolese peasants
whose loyal insurrection against the Bavarians was the most heroic
incident in the war, and she now joined the other nations of the continent
in excluding the commerce of Great Britain, which had made a powerful
diversion in Spain and an imposing though futile diversion on the Scheldt
to save her from national annihilation.</p>

<p>While the Walcheren expedition was preparing, two additions were made to
the cabinet. Lord Granville Leveson-Gower, brother of the Marquis of
Stafford, was admitted in June as secretary at war, and in July Harrowby,
who was created an earl, became president of the board of control with a
seat in the cabinet. After the fate of the expedition became known, though
before its final withdrawal, a serious quarrel took place between Canning
and Castlereagh. Personal jealousies had long existed between these two
statesmen, both half-Irish, half-English, and of approximately the same
age, yet widely different in character. Canning was the most brilliant
orator of his day, and no less persuasive in private conversation than in
public orations, gifted with an agile brain that leaped readily from one
idea or one project to another, but cursed with a bitter wit which lightly
aroused enduring enmities, and which, coupled with an excessive vanity,
rendered him unpopular with his colleagues, and made it difficult for any
one to take him seriously; while his rival, not less able, and much more
steady and trustworthy, a skilful manager of men, was scarcely able to
pronounce a coherent sentence. Early in April Canning pressed upon the
Duke of Portland the transfer of Castlereagh to another office. Private
communications followed between various members of the cabinet, and it was
understood that Camden, as Castlereagh's friend, should apprise him of the
prevailing view, which the king himself had approved under a threat of
Canning's resignation. The duke, however, begged<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span> Camden to postpone the
disclosure, and others of Castlereagh's friends urged Canning not to
insist upon the change pending the completion of the Walcheren expedition.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>DUEL BETWEEN CANNING AND CASTLEREAGH.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_49" id="TOPIC_49"></a>As the scheme took shape in July Camden was to resign, and thus make
possible a shifting of offices, which was to result in the Marquis
Wellesley succeeding Castlereagh as secretary for war. At last, on
September 6, the duke informed Canning of his own intention to retire on
the ground of ill-health, and at the same time disclosed the fact that no
steps had been taken to prepare Castlereagh for the proposed change in his
position. Thereupon Canning promptly sent in his own resignation, the duke
resigned the same day, and Castlereagh, learning what had passed, followed
his example two days later.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> Believing that Canning had been intriguing
against him behind his back, under the guise of friendship, he demanded
satisfaction on the 19th, and on the 21st<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> the duel was fought, in
which Canning received a slight wound. Such events provoked little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
censure in those days, and it is pleasant to know that Canning and
Castlereagh afterwards acted cordially together as colleagues. Their
enmity broke up the government. The Duke of Portland did not long survive
his withdrawal from office, and died on October 29; Leveson-Gower insisted
on following Canning into retirement.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_50" id="TOPIC_50"></a>Perceval was entrusted with the task of forming an administration, but the
new ministry was not formed without considerable negotiation. Canning
vainly endeavoured to impress first on his colleagues and then on the king
his own pretensions to the highest office, while attempts, to which the
king gave a reluctant assent, had been made to enlist the co-operation of
Grenville and Howick, who succeeded his father as Earl Grey, in 1807, but
they failed as all later attempts were destined to fail. The most
influential motive governing their conduct was, doubtless, their feeling
that they would not as ministers possess the king's confidence. Sidmouth's
following had also been approached. Sidmouth himself was considered too
obnoxious to some of Pitt's followers to be a safe member of the new
cabinet, but Vansittart was offered the chancellorship of the exchequer
and Bragge, who had taken the additional surname of Bathurst, the office
of secretary at war. They refused, however, to enter the ministry, unless
accompanied by Sidmouth himself.</p>

<p>Perceval eventually became prime minister, retaining his former offices;
Lord Bathurst, while remaining at the board of trade, presided temporarily
at the foreign office, which was offered to the Marquis Wellesley, then
serving as British ambassador to the Spanish junta at Seville, and taken
over by him in December. Hawkesbury, now Earl of Liverpool, succeeded
Castlereagh as secretary for war and the colonies, and was followed at the
home office by Richard Ryder, a brother of Harrowby. Harrowby himself gave
up the board of control in November to Melville's son, Robert Dundas, who,
however, was not made a member of the cabinet. Lord Palmerston, who had
been a junior lord of the admiralty under Portland, declined the
chancellorship of the exchequer, and though he accepted Leveson-Gower's
post as secretary at war, he was by his own desire excluded from the
cabinet.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>NEW BRITISH CONQUESTS.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_51" id="TOPIC_51"></a>While the close of the year 1809 was darkened by national<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span> disappointment
and political anxieties, the honour of British arms had been amply
vindicated in the Spanish peninsula, and the brilliant exploit of Lord
Cochrane in Basque Roads had recalled the glories of the Nile. Cochrane
had already achieved marvels under Collingwood in the Mediterranean, and
notably off the Spanish coast, when he was selected to conduct an attack
by fireships on the French squadron blockaded under the shelter of the
islands of Aix and Ol&eacute;ron. This he carried out on the night of April 11,
with a dash and skill worthy of Nelson, and unless checked by Gambier, the
admiral in command, who had been raised to the peerage after the seizure
of the Danish fleet in 1807, he must have succeeded in destroying the
whole of the enemy's ships. Gambier was afterwards acquitted by a court
martial of negligence, but the verdict of the public was against him. In
the autumn Collingwood reduced the seven Ionian islands, and gained an
important advantage by cutting out a considerable detachment of the Toulon
fleet in the Bay of Genoa. In the course of the year, too, all the
remaining French territory in the West Indies, as well as the Isle of
Bourbon in the Indian Ocean, was captured by the British navy. But this
unchallenged supremacy on the high seas did not prevent the depredations
of French gunboats on British merchantmen in the channel. Indeed after the
battle of Trafalgar, the French "sea-wasps" infesting the Channel were
more active and destructive than ever.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_52" id="TOPIC_52"></a>On October 25, being the forty-ninth anniversary of his accession, the
jubilee of George III. was celebrated with hearty and sincere rejoicings.
His popularity was not unmerited. He was politically shortsighted, but
within his range of vision few saw facts so clearly; he was obstinate and
prejudiced, but his obstinacy was redeemed by a moral intrepidity of the
highest order, and his prejudices were shared by the mass of his people.
Having lived through the seven years' war, the war of the American
revolution, and the successive wars of Great Britain against the French
monarchy and the French republic, he was now supporting, with indomitable
firmness, a war against the all-conquering French empire&mdash;the most
perilous in which this country was ever engaged. The colonial and Indian
dominions of Great Britain, reduced by the loss of the North American
colonies, had been greatly extended during<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span> his reign in other quarters of
the globe. His subjects regarded him as an Englishman to the core; they
knew him to be honest, religious, virtuous, and homely in his life; they
justly believed him, in spite of his failings, to be a power for good in
the land; and they rewarded him with a respect and affection granted to no
other British sovereign of modern times before Queen Victoria. They had
good cause to desire the continuance of his life and reason, knowing the
character of his heir-apparent, and contrasting the domestic habits of
Windsor with the licence of Carlton House.</p>

to the composition of the cabinet, is to be found in Walpole's <i>Life of

resignation in his failure to obtain the removal of Castlereagh from the
war office and in the refusal of the king and cabinet to allow him to
succeed Portland as prime minister. It is quite clear, however, that at
the time of Canning's resignation no decision had been come to about a
successor to Portland. Some correspondence had passed between Canning and
Perceval, in which each had refused to serve under the other, but that
this correspondence was unknown to the cabinet as a whole is proved by
Mulgrave's letters to Lord Lonsdale of September 11 and 15 (Phipps,
<i>Memoir of Ward</i>, pp. 210-17); in the former of these he discusses
Canning's probable conduct without referring to this correspondence, while
in the latter he only knows of such negotiations as subsequent to the
resignations of September 6 and 8. So, too, Eldon's letter to his wife of
September 11 (Twiss, <i>Life of Eldon</i>, ii., 88-90), places the whole
correspondence between Canning and Perceval after Portland's resignation
on September 6. The king was not informed of Canning's views as to a
successor to Portland till September 13, and the cabinet minute of
September 18, advising co-operation with Grenville and Grey, mentions the
selection of Canning as prime minister as a course open to the king.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_40_40" id="Footnote_40_40"></a><a href="#FNanchor_40_40"><span class="label">[40]</span></a> This is the date commonly given. The <i>Annual Register</i>, li.
(1809), 239, gives the 22nd, while Perceval refers to the result of the
duel in a letter dated the 20th (Colchester, <i>Diary</i>, ii., 209). It is
clear, however, that Canning did not receive Castlereagh's challenge till
the morning of the 20th (see his letter in <i>Annual Register</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>,
505, also his detailed statement to Camden, <i>ibid.</i>, 525), and therefore
the duel cannot have taken place till the 21st. Lord Folkestone in a
letter dated the 21st refers to the duel as having been fought at "7
o'clock this morning" (<i>Creevey Papers</i>, i., 96).<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p></div>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h3>PERCEVAL AND LIVERPOOL.</h3>


<p><a name="TOPIC_53" id="TOPIC_53"></a>The administration of Perceval, covering the period from October, 1809, to
May, 1812, coincided with a lull in the continental war save in the
Peninsula, though it saw no pause in the progress of French annexation.
Nor was it marked by many events of historical interest in domestic
affairs. When parliament was opened on January 23, 1810, it was natural
that attention should chiefly be devoted to the Walcheren expedition,
which the opposition illogically and unscrupulously contrived to use to
disparage the operations of Sir Arthur Wellesley, now Viscount Wellington,
in Spain. Grenville, who argued with some reason that 40,000 British
troops could have been employed to far better purpose in North Germany,
would have been on stronger ground if he had complained that for want of
them the British army had been unable to occupy Madrid. Castlereagh,
indeed, had confessed to Wellesley that he could not spare the necessary
reinforcements, after the reserves had been exhausted in Walcheren; but it
is by no means certain that Wellesley could have collected provisions
enough to feed a much larger force, or specie enough to pay for them.
Liverpool was driven in reply to Grenville to magnify the value of the
capture of Flushing, as the necessary basis of the naval armaments which
Napoleon had intended to launch against England from the Scheldt. The
government was also defended by the young Robert Peel, lately elected to
parliament. As the calamity was irreparable, a committee of the whole
house spent most of its time on a constitutional question, regarding a
private memorandum placed before the king by Chatham in his own defence.
So irregular a proceeding was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span> properly condemned, and Chatham resigned
the mastership of the ordnance, but the policy of the Walcheren expedition
was approved by a vote of the house of commons. Mulgrave received the
office Chatham had vacated, and was himself succeeded by Yorke at the
admiralty.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_54" id="TOPIC_54"></a>Parliament was next occupied by a question of privilege, in which Sir
Francis Burdett, member for Westminster, then a favourite of the
democracy, played a part resembling that of John Wilkes a generation
earlier. Burdett had been for fourteen years a member of parliament, and
had been conspicuous from the first for the vehemence of his opposition to
the government, and more especially to its supposed infringements of the
liberty of the subject. He had more recently taken an active part on
behalf of Wardle's attack on the Duke of York and had supported the
charges of ministerial corruption in the previous session. On the present
occasion one John Gale Jones, president of a debating club, had published
in a notice of debate the terms of a resolution which his club had passed,
condemning in extravagant language the exclusion of strangers from the
house of commons. This was treated as a breach of privilege, and Jones was
sent to Newgate by order of the house itself. Burdett, in a violent letter
to Cobbett's <i>Register</i>, challenged the right of the house to imprison
Jones by its own authority, and, after a fierce debate lasting two nights,
was adjudged by the house, on April 5, to have been guilty of a still more
scandalous libel. Accordingly, the speaker issued a warrant for his
committal to the Tower. Burdett declared his resolution to resist arrest,
the populace mustered in his defence, the riot act was read, and he was
conveyed to prison by a strong military escort, on whose return more
serious riots broke out, and were not quelled without bloodshed. On his
release at the end of the session a repetition of these scenes was
prevented by the simple expedient of bringing him home by water. During
his imprisonment he wrote an offensive letter to the speaker, and his
colleague, Lord Cochrane, presented a violently worded petition from his
Westminster constituents. In the following year he sued the speaker and
the sergeant-at-arms in the court of king's bench, which decided against
him on the ground that a power of commitment was necessary for the
maintenance of the dignity of the house of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span> commons, and its decision was
confirmed, on appeal, by the court of exchequer chamber and the house of
lords.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE CURRENCY QUESTION.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_55" id="TOPIC_55"></a>The most important subject of internal policy discussed in the session of
1810 was the state of the currency. Since 1797 cash payments had been
suspended, the issue of banknotes had been nearly doubled, and the price
of commodities had risen enormously. Whether these results had in their
turn promoted the expansion of foreign commerce and internal industry was
vigorously disputed by two rival schools of economists. The one thing
certain was the increasing scarcity of specie, and the serious loss
incurred in its provision for the service of the army in the Peninsula.
Francis Horner, then rising to eminence, obtained the appointment of what
became known as the "bullion committee" to inquire into the anomalous
conditions thus created, and took a leading part in the preparation of its
celebrated report, published on September 20. The committee arrived at the
conclusion that the high price of gold was mainly due to excess in the
paper-currency, and not, as alleged, to a drain of gold for the
continental war. They attributed that excess to "the want of a sufficient
check and control in the issues of paper from the Bank of England, and
originally to the suspension of cash-payments, which removed the natural
and true control". While allowing that paper could not be rendered
suddenly convertible into specie without dislocating the entire business
of the country, they recommended that an early provision should be made by
parliament for terminating the suspension of cash-payments at the end of
two years. These conclusions were combated by Castlereagh and Vansittart,
who afterwards, in 1811, succeeded in carrying several
counter-resolutions, of which the general effect was to explain the
admitted rise in the price of gold, for the most part by the exclusion of
British trade from the continent, and the consequent export of the
precious metals in lieu of British manufactures. The last resolution,
while it recognised the wisdom of restoring cash-payments as soon as it
could safely be done, affirmed it to be "highly inexpedient and dangerous
to fix a definite period for the removal of the restriction on
cash-payments prior to the conclusion of a definitive treaty of peace".
These counsels prevailed, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span> the restriction was not actually removed
until Peel's act was passed in July, 1819.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_56" id="TOPIC_56"></a>The last domestic event in the inglorious annals of 1810 was the final
lapse of the king into mental derangement in the month of November. For
more than six years his sight had been failing, but he had suffered no
return of insanity since 1804. Now he lost both his sight and his reason.
This event, impending for some time, was precipitated by the illness and
death of the Princess Amelia, his favourite daughter, and was perhaps
aggravated by the Walcheren expedition and the disgrace of the Duke of
York. Parliament met on November 1, and was adjourned more than once
before a committee was appointed to examine the royal physicians. Acting
on their report, the ministers proposed and carried resolutions declaring
the king's incapacity, and the right and duty of the two houses to provide
for the emergency. It was also determined to define by act of parliament
the powers to be exercised in the king's name and behalf. This implied a
limitation of the regent's authority, and was resented by the Prince of
Wales and his friends. Perceval, however, was able to rely on the
precedent of 1788, to which Grenville, for one, had been a party, and,
after considerable opposition, the prince was made regent under several
temporary restrictions. With certain exceptions, he was precluded from
granting any peerage or office tenable for life; the royal property was
vested in trustees for the king's benefit, and the personal care of the
king was entrusted to the queen, with the advice of a council. In this
form, the regency bill was passed on February 4, 1811, after a protest
from the other sons of George III. and violent attacks upon Eldon by
Grenville and Grey. On the 5th, the regent took the oaths before the privy
council, but, in accepting the restrictions, he delicately expressed
regret that he should not have been trusted to impose upon himself proper
limitations for the exercise of royal patronage. The interregnum thus
established was to be provisional only, and was to cease on February 1,
1812, but the queen and her private council, with the concurrence of the
privy council, were empowered to annul it at any time, by announcing the
king's recovery, when he could resume his powers by proclamation.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE REGENCY BILL.</i></div>

<p>The hopes of the opposition had been greatly excited by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span> the prospect of a
regency, and it was generally expected that a change of ministry would be
its immediate consequence. Private communications had, in fact, passed
between the prince and the whig lords, Grenville and Grey, but they were
rendered nugatory by the dictatorial tone assumed by those lords and by
the unwillingness of the prince to dispense with the advice of Moira and
Sheridan. The two whig lords had by the prince's desire prepared a reply
to the address from the houses of parliament, preparatory to the regency
bill. Grenville had voted in favour of the restriction on the creation of
peers, and it is therefore not surprising that the reply which he and Grey
drafted appeared to the prince too weak in its protest against the
limitations. He therefore adopted in its stead another reply which
Sheridan had composed for him. The two lords thereupon addressed to the
prince a remonstrance, which practically claimed for themselves the right
of responsible ministers to be the sole advisers of their prince. This
remonstrance provoked the ridicule of Sheridan, and certainly did not
please the prince, who since the fall of the Grenville ministry had
refused to be regarded as a "party man". The regent, accordingly, gave
Perceval to understand that he intended to retain his present ministers,
but solely on the ground that he was unwilling to do anything which might
retard his father's recovery, or distress him when he should come to
himself. This reason was probably genuine. The king appeared to be
recovering; he had had several interviews with Perceval and Eldon, and had
made inquiries as to the prince's intentions. Soon, however, the malady
took a turn for the worse, and the physicians came to the conclusion that
it was permanent.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_57" id="TOPIC_57"></a>Before February, 1812, when the restrictions expired, and a permanent
regency bill was passed, the prince drifted further away from his former
advisers, and had been pacified by the loyal attitude of Perceval and
Eldon. Further overtures were conveyed to the whig lords through a letter
from the prince regent to the Duke of York, in which he declared that he
had "no predilections to indulge or resentments to gratify," but only a
concern for the public good, towards which he desired the co-operation of
some of his old whig friends, in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>dicating Grenville and Grey. They
declined in a letter to the Duke of York, alleging differences on grounds
of policy too deep to admit of a coalition. Eldon, on his part, expressed
a similar conviction, but the regent never fully forgave what he regarded
as their desertion. Wellesley, who was strongly opposed to Perceval's
policy of maintaining the catholic disabilities, resigned the
secretaryship of foreign affairs, protesting against the feeble support
given to his brother in the Peninsula, and was succeeded by Castlereagh.
In April Sidmouth became president of the council in place of Camden, who
remained in the cabinet without office; and in the next month, on May 11,
Perceval was assassinated in the lobby of the house of commons by a man
named Bellingham, who had an imaginary grievance against the government.</p>

<p>A very general and sincere tribute of respect was paid by the house to
Perceval's memory, for, though his statesmanship was of the second order,
he was far more than a tory partisan; he was an excellent debater, and a
thoroughly honest politician, and his private character was above all
reproach or suspicion. The cabinet was bewildered by his death, and a
fresh attempt was made to strengthen it by the simple inclusion of Canning
as well as Wellesley. Wellesley stipulated that the catholic question
should be left open, and that the war should be prosecuted with the entire
resources of the country, while Canning declined co-operation on the
ground of the catholic question alone. No agreement being found possible,
the house of commons stepped in and addressed the regent, begging him to
form a strong and efficient administration, commanding the confidence of
all classes. He replied by sending for Wellesley, offering him the
premiership and entrusting him with the formation of a comprehensive
ministry; but Wellesley soon found that Liverpool and his adherents would
not serve under him at all, while Grenville and Grey, who secretly
condemned the Peninsular war, would only serve on conditions which he
could not grant. Once more, the regent treated directly with these haughty
whigs, now including Moira, to whom he committed the task of forming an
administration. Grenville and Grey raised difficulties about the
appointments in the royal household, which they wished to include in the
political changes, and the negotiation was broken off. The regent at last
fell<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span> back on Liverpool, a capable and conciliatory minister, who adopted
Perceval's colleagues, and a spell of tory administration set in which
remained unbroken for no less than fifteen years. Had more tact been shown
on all sides, had the whigs been less peremptory in their demands, and had
the trivial household question never arisen, the course of the war, if not
of European history, might, whether for good or evil, have been profoundly
modified.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>SOCIAL REFORMS.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_58" id="TOPIC_58"></a>During the later period of Perceval's administration, from 1811 to 1812,
the strife of politics had been mainly concentrated on the regency
question, the chance of ministerial changes, and the fortunes of the war
in Spain. But it must not be supposed that social questions were
neglected, even in the darkest days of the war, however meagre the
legislative fruits may appear. Session after session, Romilly pressed
forward reforms of the criminal law, the institution of penitential houses
in the nature of reformatories, and the abolition of state lotteries.
Others laboured, and with greater success, to remedy the delays and reduce
the arrears in the court of chancery. Constant efforts were made to expose
defalcations in the revenue, to curtail exorbitant salaries, and to put
down electioneering corruption. In 1809 Erskine introduced a bill for the
prevention of cruelty to animals. In 1810 there were earnest, if somewhat
futile, debates on spiritual destitution, the non-residence and poverty of
the clergy, and the scarcity of places of worship. Moreover, early in
1811, a premonitory symptom of the repeal movement caused some anxiety in
Ireland. It took the form of a scheme for a representative assembly to sit
in Dublin, and manage the affairs of the Roman catholic population, under
colour of framing petitions to parliament, and seeking redress of
grievances. It was, of course, to consist of Roman catholics only, and to
include Roman catholic bishops. The Irish government wisely suppressed the
scheme, and Perceval justified their action, on the ground that a
representative assembly in Dublin, with such aims in view, bordered upon
an illicit legislature.</p>

<p>Except for the war in the Spanish peninsula, and the war between Russia
and the Porte on the Danube, the year 1810 was marked by undisturbed peace
throughout the continent of Europe. France continued to make annexations,
but they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span> were at the expense of her allies, not of her enemies. Her
supremacy was signalised in a striking way by the marriage of her
<i>parvenu</i> emperor, whose divorce the pope still refused to recognise, with
Maria Louisa, daughter of the Emperor of Austria. Though thirteen out of
twenty-six cardinals present in Paris declined to attend it, this marriage
was a masterstroke of Talleyrand's diplomacy; it secured the benevolent
neutrality of Austria for the next three years, and weakened the counsels
of the allies during the negotiations of 1814-15. But it went far to
estrange the Tsar of Russia, who, though he had courteously declined
Napoleon's overtures for the hand of his own sister, was greatly offended
on discovering that another matrimonial alliance had been contracted by
his would-be brother-in-law before his reply could be received.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_59" id="TOPIC_59"></a>It was only within the limits of the French empire that Napoleon's
authority had been sufficient to enforce the rigorous exclusion of British
goods. His allies, including Sweden, which closed her ports to British
products in January, 1810, and declared war on Great Britain in the
following November, had adopted the continental system; but administrative
weakness, and the obvious interest that every people had in its
infraction, rendered its operation partial. Napoleon, determined to
enforce the system in spite of every obstacle, met this difficulty by
placing in immediate subjection to the French crown the territories where
British goods were imported. The first ally to suffer was his own brother,
Louis, King of Holland. His refusal to enforce Napoleon's orders against
the admission of British goods was followed at once by a forced cession of
part of Holland to France and the establishment of French control at the
custom houses, and shortly afterwards by the despatch of French troops
into Holland and its annexation to France on July 9, 1810. In December the
French dominion over the North Sea coast was extended by the annexation of
a corner of Germany, including the coast as far as the Danish frontier,
and the town of L&uuml;beck on the Baltic. As a result of this annexation, the
duchy of Oldenburg, held by a branch of the Russian imperial family,
ceased to exist. The act was a conspicuous breach of the treaty of Tilsit,
which Napoleon considered himself at liberty to disregard, as Russia had
shown by her conduct during the campaign of 1809 that she was no longer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
more than a nominal ally of France. At last, on January 12, 1811, Russia
asserted her independence in fiscal matters by an order which declared her
ports open to all vessels sailing under a neutral flag, and imposed a duty
on many French products. Still the course of French annexation crept
onwards, and quietly absorbed the republic of Vallais in Switzerland,
which had been a great centre of smuggling.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE CONTINENTAL SYSTEM.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_60" id="TOPIC_60"></a>Meanwhile, the restrictions and prohibitions which formed the continental
system were made more and more severe. By the Trianon tariff of August,
1810, heavy duties were levied on colonial products, and by the
Fontainebleau decree of October 18 all goods of British origin were to be
seized and publicly burned. In November a special tribunal was created to
try offenders against the continental system. Nevertheless, the fiscal and
foreign policy of France at this date alike show how far the continental
system had failed in its object, and to what extreme lengths it had become
necessary to push it in order to give it a chance of success. The strain
of the system on English commerce was immense, but the burden fell far
more heavily on the continental nations. Colonial produce rose to enormous
prices in France, Germany, and Italy, especially after the introduction of
the Trianon tariff, and a subject or ally of the French emperor had to pay
ten times as much for his morning cup of coffee as his enemy in London.
The German opposition to Napoleon had failed in 1809 mainly through the
political apathy of the German nation. Napoleon's fiscal measures were the
surest way of bringing that apathy to an end, and converting it into
hostility.</p>

<p>The events of December, 1810, and January, 1811, constituted a distinct
breach between France and Russia, which could only end in war, unless one
party or the other should withdraw from its position. A few months
sufficed to show that no such withdrawal would take place; but neither
power was prepared for war, and seventeen months elapsed after the breach
before hostilities began. The intervening period was spent in negotiation
and preparation. Much depended on the alliances that the rival powers
might be able to contract. Although Napoleon had bound himself not to
restore Poland, he had by the creation and subsequent enlargement of the
duchy of Warsaw given it a semblance of national unity, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span> had inspired
the Poles with the hope of a more complete independence. The Polish troops
were among the most devoted in the French army, and the position of their
country rendered the support of the Poles a matter of great importance in
any war with Russia. It occurred to the Tsar Alexander that he might win
their support for himself by a restoration of Poland, under the suzerainty
of Russia. He promised Czartoryski the restoration of the eight provinces
under a guarantee of autonomy, and undertook to obtain the cession of
Galicia. On February 13, 1811, he made a secret offer to Austria of a part
of Moldavia in exchange for Galicia. Nothing came of this, but the massing
of Russian troops on the Polish frontier in March was met by the hurried
advance of French troops through Germany, and war seemed imminent until
Russia postponed the struggle by withdrawing her troops.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, other European powers looked forward to selling their alliance
on the best possible terms. Sweden and Prussia both approached the
stronger power first. Bernadotte, on behalf of Sweden, was prepared for a
French alliance if France would favour the Swedish acquisition of Norway.
Napoleon, on February 25, not only refused these terms, but ordered Sweden
to enforce the continental system under pain of a French occupation of
Swedish Pomerania. This threat Sweden ventured to ignore. Prussia, lying
directly between the two future belligerents, was in a more dangerous
position. Neutrality was impossible, because her neutrality would not be
respected. She first offered her alliance to Napoleon in return for a
reduction of the payments due to France and a removal of the limit imposed
on her army. Napoleon did not reply to this offer at once. Meanwhile the
movement of French troops already mentioned and the increase of the French
garrisons on the Oder, though primarily intended for the defence of
Poland, caused great alarm in Prussia and resulted in preparations to
resist a French attack. In July Napoleon finally refused to discuss the
Prussian terms. Ever since his marriage he had been inclined more and more
to an Austrian alliance. On March 26 of this year Otto, his ambassador at
Vienna, had received information that France would support Austria if she
would protest against the occupation of Belgrade by the Serbs. Napoleon
even assured Otto that he was prepared to undertake<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span> any engagement that
Austria desired. Rest was, however, essential to Austria. The military
disasters of 1809 had been followed by national bankruptcy, and with the
government paper at a discount of 90 per cent. she dared not incur further
liabilities.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_61" id="TOPIC_61"></a>Russia had an advantage over France in that she was able to free herself
from her entanglement in Turkey, while Napoleon could not make peace
either with Great Britain or with the Bourbon party in Spain. An armistice
with the Porte was concluded on October 15. By that time all pretence of
friendly intentions had been abandoned by France and Russia. Prussia,
hoping still to save herself from an unconditional alliance with France,
now turned to Russia, and Scharnhorst was despatched to seek a Russian
alliance. Meanwhile Napoleon sent word to the Prussian court that, if her
military preparations were not suspended, he would order Davo&ucirc;t to march
on Berlin, and at the same time disclosed his offer of an unconditional
alliance against Russia. Prussia, hoping for Russian aid still, put aside
the French demands, but the Tsar Alexander expressed a decided preference
for a defensive campaign against France, and refused any assistance unless
the French should commit an unprovoked aggression on K&ouml;nigsberg.
Scharnhorst seems to have seen the wisdom of this policy. He now turned to
Austria, but there again a definite alliance was refused. Russia was
equally unable to move Austria to join her, so that Russia and Prussia
were each isolated in their opposition to Napoleon.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_62" id="TOPIC_62"></a>In the months of August and September of this year a British force,
commanded by Auchmuty, effected the conquest of Java, the wealthiest of
the East Indian islands. The island had been a Dutch colony, and like
other Dutch colonies had passed into the hands of France. Sumatra fell
into English hands along with Java, so that the supremacy of Great Britain
in the East Indies was fully established.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>LIVERPOOL'S MINISTRY.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_63" id="TOPIC_63"></a>The new ministry which entered on office in June, 1812, differed largely
in composition from that which had preceded it. Ryder and Yorke retired at
the death of Perceval, Harrowby returned to office, and places in the
cabinet were found for Sidmouth's adherents, Buckinghamshire, Vansittart,
and Bragge-Bathurst. Sidmouth himself succeeded Ryder as home<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span> secretary,
while Harrowby succeeded Sidmouth as president of the council. Earl
Bathurst took Liverpool's place as secretary for war and the colonies.
Vansittart succeeded Perceval at the exchequer and Bragge-Bathurst in the
duchy of Lancaster. Robert Dundas, now Viscount Melville, followed Yorke
at the admiralty, and Buckinghamshire took Melville's place at the board
of control, which became once more a cabinet office. Eldon, Castlereagh,
Westmorland, and Mulgrave retained their former offices, while Camden
remained in the cabinet without office. In September Mulgrave was created
an earl, and Camden a marquis. The internal history of England during the
first two years of Liverpool's premiership has been entirely dwarfed by
the interest of external events. For this period comprised not only the
Russian expedition&mdash;the greatest military tragedy in modern history&mdash;the
marvellous resurrection of Germany, with the campaigns which culminated in
the stupendous battle of Leipzig, and the invasion of France which ended
in the abdication of Napoleon at Fontainebleau, but also the brilliant
conclusion of the Peninsular war, and the earlier stages of the war
between Great Britain and the United States.</p>

<p>The nation was contented to leave the guidance of home and foreign policy
at that critical time to the existing ministers, all honest, experienced,
and high-minded statesmen, but none gifted with any signal ability, and
inferior both in cleverness and in eloquence to the leaders of the
opposition. Napoleon was not far wrong in regarding the British
aristocracy, which they represented, as his most inveterate and powerful
enemy; but he was grievously deceived in imagining that this aristocracy,
in withstanding his colossal ambition, had not the British nation at its
back. The electoral body, indeed, to which they owed their parliamentary
majority, was but a fraction of the population, and the public opinion
which supported them may seem but the voice of a privileged class in these
days of household suffrage. But there is little reason to doubt that, if
household suffrage had then prevailed, their foreign policy would have
received a democratic sanction; nor is it at all certain that some
features of their home policy, now generally condemned, were not
justified, in the main, by the exigencies of their time.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>INDUSTRIAL DISTRESS.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_64" id="TOPIC_64"></a>The "condition of England," as it was then loosely termed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span> was the first
subject which claimed the attention of Liverpool's government. While
Perceval was congratulating parliament on the elasticity of the revenue, a
widespread depression of industry was producing formidable disturbances in
the midland counties. This depression was the consequence partly of the
continental system, crippling the export of British goods to European
countries; partly of the revival, in February, 1811, of the American
non-intercourse act, closing the vast market of the United States; and
partly of the improvements in machinery, especially those in spinning and
weaving machines introduced by the inventions of Cartwright and Arkwright.
Unhappily, this last cause, being the only one visible to artisans, was
regarded by them as the sole cause of their distress. During the autumn
and winter of 1811 "Luddite" riots broke out among the stocking-weavers of
Nottingham. Their name was derived from a half-witted man who had
destroyed two stocking frames many years before. Frame-breaking on a grand
scale became the object of an organised conspiracy, which extended its
operations from Nottinghamshire into Derbyshire, Leicestershire,
Lancashire, and Yorkshire. At first frame-breaking was carried on by large
bodies of operatives in broad daylight, and when these open proceedings
were put down by military force, they were succeeded by nightly outrages,
sometimes attended by murder. Early in 1812 a bill was passed making
frame-breaking a capital offence.</p>

<p>In spite of this riots grew into local insurrections, and a message from
the prince regent on June 27 recommended further action to parliament. It
was natural, in that generation to connect all disorderly movements with
revolutionary designs, and this belief underlies an alarmist report from a
secret committee of the house of lords on the prevailing tumults.
Accordingly, Sidmouth obtained new powers for magistrates to search for
arms, to disperse tumultuous assemblies, and to exercise jurisdiction
beyond their own districts. In November many Luddites were convicted, and
sixteen were executed by sentence of a special commission sitting at York.
These stern measures were effectual for a time, and popular discontent in
the manufacturing districts ceased to assume so acute a form until after
the war was ended.</p>

<p>The sufferings of the poor in the rural districts, though<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span> generally
endured in silence, were at least equally severe with those of the artisan
class, and it is difficult to say whether a good or bad harvest pressed
more heavily on agricultural labourers. When the price of wheat rose to
130s. per quarter or upwards, as it did in 1812 and other years of
scarcity, the farmers were able to pay comparatively high wages. When the
price fell to 75s., as it did in years of plenty like 1813, wages were
reduced to starvation-point, but supplemented out of the poor-rates, under
the miserable system of indiscriminate out-door relief graduated according
to the size of families. In either case, the entire income of a labourer
was far below the modern standard, and the prosperity of trade meant to
him an increase in the cost of all necessaries except bread. As for their
employers, the golden age of farming, which is often identified with the
age of the great war, had really ceased long before. Not only did the high
price of a farmer's purchases go far to neutralise the high price of his
sales, but the excessive fluctuations in all prices, due to the opening
and closing of markets according to the fortunes of war, made prudent
speculation almost impossible. The frequently recurring depressions were
rendered all the more disastrous, because in times of high prices "the
margin of cultivation" was unduly extended.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CORN LAWS.</i></div>

<p>With a view to diminish the violence of these fluctuations, a select
committee on the corn-trade was appointed by the house of commons in 1813,
and reported in favour of a sliding-scale. When the price of wheat should
fall below 90s. per quarter, its exportation was to be permitted; but its
importation was to be forbidden, until the price should reach 103s., when
it might, indeed, be imported, but under "a very considerable duty". It
was assumed, in fact, that the normal price of wheat was above 100s. per
quarter, and the price above which importation should be permitted was
nearly twice as high as that fixed in 1801, when, moreover, it was to be
admitted above 50s. at a duty of 2s. 6d., and above 54s. at a duty of
sixpence. It is remarkable that in the debates of 1814 upon the report of
this committee, William Huskisson, as well as Sir Henry Parnell, supported
its main conclusions, upon the ground that agriculture must be upheld at
all costs, and the home-market preferred to foreign markets. Canning and
others ably advocated the cause of the consumers, alleging that duties on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
corn injured them far more than they could benefit landowners or farmers.
Finally, a bill embodying a modified sliding-scale was introduced by the
government, and, though lost by a narrow majority in 1814, became law in
1815. Under this act the importation of foreign corn was prohibited, so
long as the price of wheat did not rise above 80s. Above that price it
might be imported free. Corn from British North America might, however, be
imported free so long as the price of wheat exceeded 67s.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_65" id="TOPIC_65"></a>The parliamentary debates of 1812 chiefly turned on Spanish affairs, the
revocation of the orders in council, the subsequent rupture with the
United States which had anticipated this great concession, and the
wearisome cabinet intrigues which preceded the accession of Liverpool as
prime minister. It is noteworthy that so conservative a house of commons
should actually have pledged itself to consider the question of catholic
emancipation in the next session, and should have passed an act relieving
nonconformists from various disabilities. The next session of this
parliament, however, never came, for an unexpected dissolution took place
on September 29. This dissolution was attributed, with some reason, to a
wish on the part of the government to profit by an abundant harvest, and
to the restoration of comparative quiet both in England and in Ireland. A
new parliament assembled at the end of November. The prince regent's
speech in opening it, though it noticed the suppression of the Luddite
disturbances, was inevitably devoted to the great events in Spain and
Russia, the conclusion of a treaty with Russia, and the American
declaration of war. After the Christmas recess, Castlereagh presented an
argumentative message from the prince fully discussing the points at issue
between Great Britain and the United States, upon which Canning, though
out of office, delivered a vigorous speech in defence of the British
position. Eldon, in the house of lords, went further, boldly justifying
the right of search, and denying the American contention that original
allegiance could be cancelled by naturalisation without the consent of the
mother-country. The Princess of Wales, who had long been separated from
the prince, was the cause of more parliamentary time being wasted by a
complaint which she addressed to the speaker against the proceedings of
the privy council. That body had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span> approved restrictions which her husband
had thought fit to place on her intercourse with her daughter, the
Princess Charlotte. Parliament, however, took no action in the matter.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_66" id="TOPIC_66"></a>Perhaps the most important measure enacted in the session of 1813 was the
so-called East India company's act. By this act the charter of the company
was renewed with a confirmation of its administrative privileges and its
monopoly of the China trade, but subject to material reservations: the
India trade was thrown open from April 10, 1814, and the charter itself,
thus restricted, was made terminable by three years' notice after April
10, 1831. In this year the naval and military armaments of Great Britain,
considered as a whole, perhaps reached their maximum strength, and the
national expenditure rose to its highest level, including, as it did,
subsidies to foreign powers amounting to about &pound;10,500,000. Of the
aggregate expenditure, about two-thirds, &pound;74,000,000, were provided by
taxation, an enormous sum relatively to the population and wealth of the
country at that period. Patiently as this burden was borne on the whole by
the people of Great Britain, we cannot wonder that Vansittart, the
chancellor of the exchequer, should have sought to lighten it in some
degree by encroaching upon the sinking fund, as founded and regulated by
Pitt. The debates on this complicated question, in which Huskisson and
Tierney stoutly combated Vansittart's proposal, belong rather to financial
history. What strikes a modern student of politics as strange is that
Vansittart, tory as he was, should have advocated the relief of living and
suffering taxpayers, upon the principle, then undefined, of leaving money
"to fructify in the pockets of the people"; while the whig economists of
the day stickled for the policy of piling up new debts, if need be, rather
than break in upon an empirical scheme for the gradual extinction of old
debts.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<h3>THE PENINSULAR WAR.</h3>


<p><a name="TOPIC_67" id="TOPIC_67"></a>Reference has already been made to the conflict maintained for six years
by Great Britain against France for the liberation of Spain and Portugal,
which has since been known in history as the Peninsular war. It had its
origin in two events which occurred during the autumn of 1807 and the
spring of 1808. The first was the secret treaty of Fontainebleau concluded
between France and Spain at the end of October, 1807; the second was the
outbreak of revolutionary movements at Madrid, followed by the
intervention of Napoleon in March, April, and May, 1808. The treaty of
Fontainebleau was a sequel of the vast combination against Great Britain
completed by the peace of Tilsit, under which the continental system was
to be enforced over all Europe. Portugal, the ally of this country and an
emporium of British commerce, was to be partitioned into principalities
allotted by Napoleon, the house of Braganza was to be exiled, and its
transmarine possessions were to be divided between France and Spain, then
ruled by the worthless Godoy in the name of King Charles IV. <a name="TOPIC_68" id="TOPIC_68"></a>Whether or
not the subjugation of the whole peninsula was already designed by
Napoleon, his troops, ostensibly despatched for the conquest of Portugal
under the provisions of the treaty, had treacherously occupied commanding
positions in Spain, when the populace of Madrid rose in revolt, and,
thronging the little town of Aranjuez, where the court resided, frightened
the king into abdication. His unprincipled son, Ferdinand, was proclaimed
in March, 1808, but Murat, who now entered Madrid as commander-in-chief of
the French troops in that city, secretly favoured the ex-King Charles. In
the end, both he and Ferdinand were enticed into seeking the protection
of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span> Napoleon at Bayonne. Instead of mediating or deciding between them,
Napoleon soon found means to get rid of both. They were induced or rather
compelled to resign their rights, and retire into private life on large
pensions; and Napoleon conferred the crown of Spain on his brother Joseph,
whose former kingdom of Naples was bestowed on Murat.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_69" id="TOPIC_69"></a>In the meantime, sanguinary riots broke out afresh at Madrid, hundreds of
French were massacred, and the insurrection, as it was called, though
sternly put down by Murat, spread like wildfire into all parts of Spain. A
violent explosion of patriotism, resulting in anarchy, followed throughout
the whole country. Napoleon was taken by surprise, but the combinations
which he matured at Bayonne for the conquest of Spain were as masterly as
those by which he had well-nigh subdued the whole continent, except
Russia. He established a base of operations in the centre of the country,
and organised four campaigns in the north-west, north-east, south-east,
and south. Savary, who had succeeded Murat at Madrid, was supposed to act
as commander-in-chief, but was really little more than a medium for
transmitting orders received from Napoleon at Bayonne. The campaign of
Duhesme in Catalonia was facilitated by the treacherous seizure of the
citadel of Barcelona in the previous February. It was not long, however,
before effective aid was rendered on the coast by the British fleet under
Collingwood, and especially by Lord Cochrane in the <i>Imp&eacute;rieuse</i> frigate;
the undisciplined bands of Catalonian volunteers were reinforced by
regular troops from Majorca and Minorca; the fortress of Gerona made an
obstinate resistance; the siege of it was twice raised, and Barcelona,
almost isolated, was now held with difficulty.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>FRANCE OCCUPIES THE PENINSULA.</i></div>

<p>Marshal Moncey vainly besieged Valencia, while Generals
Lefebvre-Desno&euml;ttes and Verdier were equally unsuccessful before Zaragoza.
In the plains of Leon, Marshal Bessi&egrave;res gained a decisive victory over a
superior force of Spaniards under Cuesta and Blake, at Medina de Rio Seco,
on July 14. Having thus secured the province of Leon, and the great route
from Bayonne to Madrid, he was advancing on Galicia when his progress was
arrested by disaster in another quarter. General Dupont, commanding the
southern army, found himself nearly surrounded at Baylen, and solicited an
armistice,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span> followed by a convention, under which, "above eighteen
thousand French soldiers laid down their arms before a raw army incapable
of resisting half that number, if the latter had been led by an able
man".<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> The convention, signed on July 20, stipulated for the transport
of the French troops to France, but its stipulations were shamefully
violated; some were massacred, others were sent to sicken in the hulks at
Cadiz, and comparatively few lived to rejoin their colours. <a name="TOPIC_70" id="TOPIC_70"></a>Meanwhile a
so-called "assembly of notables," summoned to Bayonne, consisting of
ninety-one persons, all nominees of Napoleon, assumed to act for the whole
nation, had accepted the nomination of Joseph Bonaparte as king, and
proceeded to adopt a constitution. On July 20, the very day of the
capitulation of Baylen, Joseph entered Madrid, and on the 24th was
proclaimed King of Spain and the Indies. But the military prestige of the
grand army received a fatal blow in the catastrophe, of which the
immediate effect was the retirement of Joseph behind the Ebro, and the
ultimate effects were felt in the later history of the war.</p>

<p>At this moment almost the whole of Portugal was in possession of the
French. In November, 1807, under peremptory orders from Napoleon, Junot
with a French army and an auxiliary force of Spaniards, but without money
or transport, had marched with extraordinary rapidity across the mountains
to Alcantara in the valley of the Tagus. He thence pressed forward to
Lisbon, hoping to anticipate the embarkation of the royal family for
Brazil, which, however, took place just before his arrival and almost
under his eyes. With his army terribly reduced by the hardships and
privations of his forced march, he overawed Lisbon and issued a
proclamation that "the house of Braganza had ceased to reign". A fortnight
later a Spanish division occupied Oporto, and meanwhile another Spanish
division established itself in the south-east of Portugal, but, as the
French stragglers came in and reinforcements approached, Junot felt
himself strong enough to cast off all disguise; he suppressed the council
of regency, took the government into his own hands, and levied a heavy war
contribution. During the early months of 1808 he was employed in
reorganising his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span> own forces, and the resources of Lisbon, where an
auxiliary Russian fleet of nine ships was lying practically blockaded. In
a military sense, he was successful, but the rapacity of the French, the
contagion of the Spanish uprising, the memory of the old alliance with
England, and the proximity of English fleets, stirred the blood of the
Portuguese nation into ill-concealed hostility. The Spanish commander at
Oporto withdrew his troops to Galicia, and the inhabitants declared for
independence. Their example was followed in other parts of Portugal. Junot
acted with vigour, disarmed the Spanish contingent at Lisbon, and sent
columns to quell disturbances on the Spanish frontiers, but he soon
realised the necessity of concentration. He therefore resolved to abandon
most of the Portuguese fortresses, limiting his efforts to holding Lisbon,
and keeping open his line of communication with Spain.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>VIMEIRO AND CINTRA.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_71" id="TOPIC_71"></a>Such was the state of affairs in the Peninsula when Sir Arthur Wellesley
landed his army of some 12,000 men on August 13, 1808. He had been
specially designated for the command of a British army in Portugal by
Castlereagh, then secretary for war and the colonies, who fully
appreciated his singular capacity for so difficult a service. Sir John
Moore, who had just returned from the Baltic, having found it hopeless to
co-operate with Gustavus IV. of Sweden, was sent out soon afterwards to
Portugal with a corps of some 10,000 men. Both these eminent soldiers were
directed to place themselves under the orders not only of Sir Hew
Dalrymple, the governor of Gibraltar, as commander-in-chief, but of Sir
Harry Burrard, when he should arrive, as second in command. Wellesley had
received general instructions to afford "the Spanish and Portuguese
nations every possible aid in throwing off the yoke of France," and was
empowered to disembark at the mouth of the Tagus. Having obtained
trustworthy information at Coru&ntilde;a and Oporto, he decided rather to begin
his campaign from a difficult landing-place south of Oporto at the mouth
of the Mondego, and to march thence upon Lisbon. He was opportunely joined
by General Spencer from the south of Spain, and chose the coast-road by
Torres Vedras. At Roli&ccedil;a he encountered a smaller force under Delaborde,
sent in advance by Junot to delay his progress, and routed it after a
severe combat. Delaborde, however, retreated with admirable tenacity, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
Wellesley, expecting reinforcements from the coast, pushed forward to
Vimeiro, without attempting to check the concentration of Junot's army.
<a name="TOPIC_72" id="TOPIC_72"></a>There was fought, on August 21, the first important battle of the
Peninsular war. The British troops, estimated at 16,778 men (besides about
2,000 Portuguese), outnumbered the French considerably, but the French
were much stronger in cavalry, and boldly assumed the offensive, confident
in the prestige derived from so many victories in Italy and Germany.
Wellesley's position was strong, but the attack on it was skilfully
designed and pressed home with resolute courage. It was repelled at every
point of the field, and the French, retiring in confusion, might have been
cut off from Lisbon. But Burrard, who had just landed and witnessed the
battle without interfering, now absolutely refused to sanction a vigorous
pursuit.</p>

<p>On the following day he was superseded in turn by Dalrymple. The new
commander determined to await the arrival of Moore, whose approach was
reported, but who did not disembark his whole force until the 30th. In the
meantime, overtures for an armistice were received from Junot, and
ultimately resulted in the so-called "convention of Cintra," though it was
first drafted at Torres Vedras and was ratified at Lisbon. Under this
agreement the French army was to surrender Lisbon intact with other
Portuguese fortresses, but was allowed to return to France with its arms
and baggage at the expense of the British government. Having dissented
from the military decision which had enabled Junot to negotiate, instead
of capitulating, Wellesley also dissented from certain terms of the
convention. He was, however, party to it as a whole, and afterwards
justified its main conditions as securing the evacuation of Portugal at
the price of reasonable concessions. This was not the feeling of the
British public, which loudly resented the escape of the French army and
insisted upon a court of inquiry. The verdict of this court saved the
military honour of all three generals, but its members were so divided in
opinion on the policy of the convention that no authoritative judgment was
pronounced. Napoleon felt no such difficulty in condemning Junot for
yielding too much, and the inhabitants of Lisbon were infuriated not only
by the loss of their expected vengeance, but also by the shameless plunder
of their public and private<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span> property by the departing French. Under a
separate convention, the Russian fleet, long blockaded in the Tagus, was
surrendered to the British admiral, but without its officers or crews.</p>

<p>The capitulation of Baylen paralysed for a time the aggressive movements
of France in Spain. Catalonia remained unconquered, even Bessi&egrave;res
retreated, and Joseph, as we have seen, abandoned Madrid. Happily for the
French, the Spaniards proved quite incapable of following up their
advantages, and though a "supreme junta" was assembled at Aranjuez, it
wasted its time in vain wrangling, and did little or nothing for the
organisation of national defence. Meanwhile, Napoleon was pouring veteran
troops from Germany into the north of Spain, where they repulsed the
Spanish levies in several minor engagements. On October 14 he left Erfurt,
where he had renewed his alliance with the tsar, and reached Bayonne on
November 3. His simple but masterly plan of campaign was already prepared,
and was carried out with the utmost promptitude. On November 10-11, one of
three Spanish armies was crushed at Espinosa; on the former day another
was routed at Gamonal; on the 23rd the third was utterly dispersed at
Tudela. Napoleon himself remained for some days at Burgos, awaiting the
result of these operations; on December 4, after a feeble resistance, he
entered Madrid in triumph, and stayed there seventeen days, which he
employed with marvellous activity in maturing fresh designs, both civil
and military, for securing his power in Spain.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>ADVANCE OF SIR JOHN MOORE.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_73" id="TOPIC_73"></a>Already, on October 7, Sir John Moore had taken over the command of the
British forces. He probably owed his appointment to George III., who seems
on this occasion to have overruled his foreign and war ministers, Canning
and Castlereagh. In spite of his unwillingness to offer the appointment to
Moore, Castlereagh gave him the most loyal and efficient support during
the whole campaign; and this loyalty to Moore was one of the reasons for
Canning's desire to remove Castlereagh from the war office, which, as we
have seen, led to the famous duel between those two statesmen. It was at
first intended that Moore should co-operate with the Spanish armies which
were then facing the French on the line of the Ebro. For this purpose he
was to have the command of 21,000 troops already in Portugal and of about
12,000 who were being sent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span> by sea to Coru&ntilde;a under Sir David Baird.
Burrard was to remain in Portugal with another 10,000. Nothing had been
done before Moore was appointed to the command to provide the troops with
their necessary equipment or their commander with the necessary local
information. The departure of the troops was therefore slow. By October 18
the greater part of the British troops in Portugal were in motion, but the
whole army had not left Lisbon till the 29th. The main body travelled by
fairly direct routes to Salamanca, where Moore arrived on November 13, but
he was induced by information, which proved to be incorrect, to send his
cavalry and guns with a column under Hope, by the more circuitous high
road through Elvas and Talavera. When this route was adopted it was
anticipated that the different divisions of the British army would be able
to unite at, or near, Valladolid. But the advance of the French rendered
this impossible, and Hope ultimately joined Moore at Salamanca on December
4.</p>

<p>Baird suffered from even more vexatious delays. Though the greater part of
his convoy had arrived at Coru&ntilde;a on October 13, the local junta would not
permit them to land without express orders from the central junta at
Aranjuez. Consequently the disembarkation did not begin till the 26th and
was only finished on November 4. Transport and equipment were difficult to
obtain, and on November 22 Baird was still only at Astorga. There
exaggerated reports of the French advance induced him to halt, but by
Moore's orders he continued his march. On the 28th the news of the defeat
of Casta&ntilde;os at Tudela reached Moore at Salamanca. Co-operation with a
Spanish army now appeared impossible, and even a junction with Baird
seemed too hazardous to attempt. Moore therefore, ordered Baird to retire
on Coru&ntilde;a and to proceed to Lisbon by sea, and, while waiting himself at
Salamanca for Hope, made preparations for a retreat to Portugal. On
December 5, the day after his junction with Hope, Moore determined to
continue his advance. He had received news of the enthusiastic
preparations for the defence of Madrid but did not know of its fall, and
he considered that the Spanish enthusiasm justified some risk on the part
of the British troops. He accordingly recalled Baird, whose infantry had
retired to Villafranca, though his cavalry were still at Astorga. On the
9th came the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span> news of the fall of Madrid, but Moore believed that an
attack on the French lines of communication might still prove useful, and
on the 11th the advance was renewed. Moore himself left Salamanca on the
13th. On the 12th he learned for the first time from some prisoners the
true strength of the French army, 250,000 of all arms, and also discovered
that the enemy were in complete ignorance of the position of his own army.
Next day an intercepted despatch showed him that he might possibly be able
to cut off Soult in an isolated position at Salda&ntilde;a. Having at last
effected a junction with Baird's corps on the 19th he reached Sahagun on
the 21st, and was on the point of delivering his attack under favourable
conditions, though his triumph must have been short-lived.</p>

<p>His real success was of another order. He had anticipated that Napoleon
would postpone everything to the opportunity of crushing a British army,
and the ultimate object of his march to Sahagun was to draw the French
away from Lisbon and Andalusia. He was not disappointed. Napoleon at last
divined that Moore was not flying in a south-westerly direction, but
carrying out a bold man&oelig;uvre in a north-easterly direction. He
instantly pushed division after division from various quarters by forced
marches upon Moore's reported track, while he himself followed with
desperate efforts across the snow-clad mountains between Madrid and the
Douro. Apprised of his swift advance, and conscious of his own vast
inferiority in numbers, Moore had no choice but to retreat without a
moment's delay upon Benevente and Astorga. He was now sufficiently far
north to prefer to retire upon Galicia rather than upon Portugal. The
retreat began on the 24th and was executed with such rapidity that on
January 1, 1809, Napoleon gave up the pursuit at Astorga, leaving it to be
continued by Soult. Whether he was influenced by intelligence of fresh
armaments on the Danube, or of dangerous plots in Paris, must remain
uncertain, but it is highly probable that he saw little honour to be won
in a laborious chase of a foe who might prove formidable if brought to
bay.</p>

<p>Moore's army, disheartened as it was by the loss of a brilliant chance,
and demoralised as it became under the fatigues and hardships of a most
harassing retreat, never failed to repel attacks on its rear, where Paget
handled the cavalry<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span> of the rear-guard with signal ability, especially in
a spirited action near Benevente. In spite of some excesses, tolerable
order was maintained until the British force, still 25,000 strong, reached
Astorga, and was joined by some 10,000 Spaniards under Roma&ntilde;a.
Thenceforward, all sense of discipline was abandoned by so many regiments
that Moore described the conduct of his whole army as "infamous beyond
belief," though it is certain that some regiments, and notably those of
the reserve, should be excepted from this sweeping condemnation.
Drunkenness, marauding, and other military crimes grew more and more
general as the main body marched "in a drove" through Villafranca to Lugo,
where Moore vainly offered battle, and onwards to Betanzos on the
sea-coast. There a marvellous rally was effected, stragglers rejoined the
ranks in unexpected numbers, the <i>moral</i> of the soldiery was restored as
the fearful strain of physical misery was relaxed, and by January 12,
1809, all the divisions of Moore's army were safely posted in or around
Coru&ntilde;a. Bad weather had delayed the fleet of transports ordered round from
Vigo, but it ran into the harbour on the 14th, and the sick and invalids
were sent on board.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE BATTLE OF CORU&Ntilde;A.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_74" id="TOPIC_74"></a>Moore was advised to make terms for the embarkation of his entire command,
but he was too good a soldier to comply. Those who took part in the battle
of Coru&ntilde;a on the 16th, some 15,000 men in all, were no unworthy
representatives of the army which started from Lisbon three months
earlier. Soult, with a larger force, assumed the offensive, and made a
determined attack on the British position in front of the harbour and town
of Coru&ntilde;a. He was repulsed at all points, but Moore was mortally, and
Baird severely, wounded on the field. Hope, who took command, knowing that
Soult would soon be reinforced, wisely persisted in carrying out Moore's
intention, evacuated Coru&ntilde;a, and embarked his army for England during the
night and the following day. His losses were estimated by Hope at above
700, killed and wounded; those of the enemy were twice as great. Thus
victory crowned a campaign which otherwise would have done little to
satisfy the popular appetite for tangible success. The original object of
supporting the Spanish resistance in the north had been rendered
impossible of fulfilment by Napoleon's victories when Moore had barely
crossed the Spanish frontier, and in this sense the expedi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>tion must be
regarded as a failure, though its commander was in no sense responsible
for its ill-success. On the other hand, considered as a skilful diversion,
the expedition was highly successful. It drew all the best French troops
and generals into the north-west corner of Spain, leaving all the other,
and far richer, provinces to recover their power of resistance.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>The spirit in which Napoleon had entered upon this contest is well
illustrated in two sentences of his address to the citizens of Madrid.
"The Bourbons," he said, "can no longer reign in Europe," and "No power
under the influence of England can exist on the continent". The
counter-proclamations of Spanish juntas were more prolix and equally
arrogant, but one of them reveals the secret of national strength when it
asserts that "a whole people is more powerful than disciplined armies".
The British estimate of Napoleon's Spanish policy was tersely expressed by
the Marquis Wellesley in the house of lords, "To him force and fraud were
alike; force, that would stoop to all the base artifices of fraud; and
fraud, that would come armed with all the fierce violence of force".</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>WELLESLEY TAKES COMMAND.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_75" id="TOPIC_75"></a>For three months after the battle of Coru&ntilde;a, the Peninsular war, as
regards the action of Great Britain, was all but suspended. Two days
before that battle, a formal treaty of peace and alliance between Great
Britain and the Spanish junta, which had withdrawn to Seville, was signed
at London. Sir John Cradock was in command of the British troops at
Lisbon, and took up a defensive position there, with reinforcements from
Cadiz, awaiting the approach of Soult, who had captured Oporto by storm,
and of Victor, who was in the valley of the Tagus. At the request of the
Portuguese, Beresford had been sent out to organise and command their
army. Early in 1809 the Spaniards were defeated with great slaughter at
Ucles, Ciudad Real, and Medellin; Zaragoza was taken after another siege,
and still more obstinate defence; and the national cause seemed more
desperate than ever. On April 2, however, Sir Arthur Wellesley, who had
returned home after the convention of Cintra, was appointed to the
command-in-chief of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span> our forces in the Peninsula. Before leaving England,
he left with the ministers a memorandum on the conduct of the war which,
viewed by the light of later events, must be accounted a masterpiece of
foresight and sagacity. When it was laid before George III., his natural
shrewdness at once discerned its true value, and he desired its author to
be informed of the strong impression which it had produced on his mind.</p>

<p>Wellesley, indeed, could not estimate beforehand the vast numerical
superiority of the French while the rest of Europe was at peace, or the
impotent vacillations of Spanish juntas, or the "mulish obstinacy" of
Spanish generals, which so often wrecked his plans and spoiled his
victories. Nor could he foresee the advantages which he would derive from
the resources of guerilla warfare, the mutual jealousies of the French
marshals, and the sudden recall of the best French troops for service in
Germany and Russia. But his prescient and practical mind firmly grasped
the dominant facts of the position&mdash;that Portugal, guarded by the ocean on
the west and by mountain ranges on the east, was far more accessible to
the British navy than to the French army; that, under British officers,
its troops might be trained into an effective force; and that, with it as
a basis, Great Britain might ultimately liberate the whole Peninsula. "I
have always been of opinion," Wellesley said in this memorandum, "that
Portugal might be defended, whatever might be the result of the contest in
Spain; and that in the meantime the measures adopted for the defence of
Portugal would be highly useful to the Spaniards in their contest with the
French." On this simple principle all his detailed recommendations were
founded, and he expressed a deliberate belief that, if 30,000 British
troops were supported by an equal number of Portuguese regulars, and a
reserve of militia was provided, "the French would not be able to overrun
Portugal with less than 100,000 men". This forecast was verified, and upon
its essential wisdom the fate of the Peninsular war, with all its
consequences, may be said to have depended.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>Wellesley landed at Lisbon on April 22, and was received with the utmost
demonstrations of joy and confidence. He found not only the capital but
the whole country in a state of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span> tumult, if not of anarchy, due to a
growing despair of the national cause. His arrival rekindled the embers of
patriotism, and on May 5 he reviewed at Coimbra a body of troops
consisting of 17,000 British and Germans, with about 8,000 Portuguese. The
next day he marched towards the Douro, and on the 14th he effected the
passage of that river in the face of the French army occupying Oporto,
which the British forthwith recaptured. Soult beat a hasty and disorderly
retreat into Galicia. Having driven Soult out of Portugal, the British
general was encouraged to undertake a further advance into Spain, where
Joseph with Victor and S&eacute;bastiani had collected a much larger army to bar
the approaches to Madrid than Wellesley, relying on Spanish intelligence,
had been led to expect. During June and the first days of July, he moved
by Abrantes and the Tagus valley as far as Plasencia, little knowing that
Soult was about to sweep round his rear, with 50,000 men, and intercept
his communications with Lisbon. On July 10 he held a conference with the
Spanish general Cuesta, who insisted on making an aggressive movement with
his own troops only, and met with a repulse.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE TALAVERA CAMPAIGN.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_76" id="TOPIC_76"></a>On the 27th, the combined armies of Wellesley and Cuesta, numbering
respectively about 20,000 British and 35,000 Spanish, confronted 46,000
French troops, under Victor, in a strong position behind Talavera.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> The
Spanish forces occupied the right and the British the left of this
position. Joseph was present, and disregarding the counsels of Jourdan,
his proper military adviser, authorised Victor to assume the offensive. He
failed in two preliminary attacks on the 27th, but renewed them on the
28th, when a general engagement ensued. The whole brunt of the battle fell
upon the British troops, who gallantly withstood a desperate onset, first
on their left and then on their centre and right, until the French quitted
the field in confusion. The Spaniards, posted in entrenchments nearer
Talavera itself, did and suffered comparatively little. Some of their
regiments fled disgracefully, but the rest held their ground, and
Wellesley in his despatch spoke favourably of their behaviour.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> Perhaps
the part which they played may be roughly estimated by their losses,
amounting to 1,200, as compared with 6,268 British<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span> and nearly 9,000
French. Wellesley, after further experience of Spanish co-operation, made
up his mind to dispense with it altogether in future.</p>

<p>The victory of Talavera won for Wellesley the rank of viscount, to which
he was raised on September 4, with the title of Wellington. Although the
victory revived the respect of foreign nations for the prowess of British
arms, it was otherwise fruitless, and its sequel was fairly open to
criticism. Wellesley found that Soult, with Ney and Mortier, had
circumvented him, and that he must retreat through Esdremadura, on the
south of the Tagus, upon Badajoz. Cuesta, who had advocated bolder
counsels, undertook to guard the rear, and to protect the British wounded
at Talavera. But he soon found it necessary to abandon that position.
Fifteen hundred of the wounded were left behind, and were humanely treated
by the French generals. Wellesley's retreat over the mountains was
attended with great hardship and loss, for want of supplies either from
Spain or from the coast, and his long encampment in the malarious valley
of the Guadiana about Badajoz swelled the number of his sick to a
frightful extent. It was not until December, when it got into better
cantonments on Portuguese soil, that the British army, triumphant at
Talavera, recovered either its health or its <i>moral</i>. Napoleon boasted, in
a memorandum to be inserted in the Paris journals, that Wellington had
really been beaten in Spain, and that "if affairs there had been properly
conducted not an Englishman would have escaped". Without going quite so
far as this, the parliamentary opposition in England made the least of the
victory and the most of the retreat, which unfortunately coincided in time
with the wreck of the Walcheren expedition. Even Wellington's best friends
in England began to lose heart, as did many of his own officers. He
remained undaunted, and having established his headquarters on the high
ground between the Tagus and the Douro, meditated designs which, slowly
matured, bore good fruit in later years.</p>

<p>It is difficult to understand the inaction of Wellington for so many
months after the Talavera campaign, without taking into account not only
the difficulty of obtaining sufficient recruits and stores from England
after the waste of both at the mouth of the Scheldt, but the greatly
increased strength of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span> French in Spain during the long interval
between the Wagram campaign and the Russian expedition. At the close of
1809 all the fortresses of Spain had fallen into the enemy's hands, and
all her principal armies had been defeated and dispersed in successive
battles of which the greatest was that of Oca&ntilde;a in the month of November.
Suchet was master of Aragon and the east of Spain, nor was he dislodged
from it until the end of the war; Andalusia was nearly conquered; Cadiz
was only saved by the self-reliant courage of the Duc d'Albuquerque,
baffling the intrigues and treachery of the supreme junta there assembled;
and Napoleon was preparing a fresh army to overrun Portugal, under the
command of Mass&eacute;na. The Perceval ministry, in which Liverpool had taken
Castlereagh's post of secretary for war and the colonies, adopting an
optimistic tone at home, practically told Wellington that he must shift
for himself; and he braced himself up to do so with extraordinary
fortitude.</p>

<p>He remained watching the gathering storm from the heights of Guarda,
south-west of Almeida, and commanding two great roads from Spain into
Portugal, but his thoughts were equally fixed upon the vast and famous
lines of Torres Vedras, which he was constructing for the defence of
Lisbon. His force, including the Portuguese regulars, did not exceed
50,000 men; that of the French under Ney, Reynier, and Junot consisted of
about 70,000, but they were not equally capable of being concentrated on a
single point. The Portuguese militia, too, were being gradually
disciplined, and the Portuguese civil authorities were being gradually
schooled into the new lesson of sweeping their own country bare of all
supplies before the coming French invasion. Wellington did not even strike
a blow to save Ciudad Rodrigo, which Mass&eacute;na took on July 10, 1810. But it
was no part of his plan that Almeida should capitulate, as it did shortly
afterwards, partly owing to the accidental explosion of a magazine, and
partly as was suspected, to an act of treachery. Still, Mass&eacute;na delayed
until urged by Napoleon, and deceived by false intelligence, he launched
forth, at the beginning of September, on an enterprise which proved fatal
to his reputation. Both he and Wellington issued appeals to the Portuguese
nation, the contrast between which is significant. The French marshal,
echoing the prevail<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>ing note of his master's proclamation, denounced Great
Britain as the enemy of all Europe; Wellington called upon the Portuguese
to remember their actual experience of French rapacity and outrage.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>BUSSACO AND TORRES VEDRAS.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_77" id="TOPIC_77"></a>The object of Mass&eacute;na was to reach Coimbra before Wellington. His
man&oelig;uvres to outflank Wellington's left were skilfully devised, but the
British army marched steadily down the valley of the Mondego, carrying
with it the population of the district, and took its stand on the ridge of
Bussaco, north of Coimbra, barring Mass&eacute;na's progress. There was fought,
on September 27, 1810, a battle as deadly as that of Talavera, and more
decisive in its consequences. The French, as usual, were the assailants;
the English and the Portuguese stood at bay. Never, in any of their
brilliant victories, did French troops show more heroic daring than in
this assault under Reynier on the British right, and under Ney on the
British left. Both columns forced their way up bare heath-clad slopes, and
reached the summit, whence they were only driven back after repeated
charges. Their loss in killed and wounded exceeded 4,500, that of the
allies was about 1,300. The French generals threw the blame of defeat upon
each other, but, in fact, the skill of Mass&eacute;na converted a defeat into an
episode in his victorious advance. On the following day, he again found a
way of turning Wellington's left, and, in an intercepted despatch, he
naturally treated this as a compensation for the repulse at Bussaco, which
he did not disguise. Compelled to retire once more with a vast drove of
encumbered, panic-stricken, and famishing Portuguese fugitives, and
conscious that no reserves awaited him, Wellington knew, nevertheless,
that he was drawing Mass&eacute;na further and further away from his base, to
encounter a terrible surprise. For, so useless had been the French scouts,
and so worthless the information received from Portuguese sources, that no
adequate conception of the obstacle presented by the lines of Torres
Vedras had entered the mind of that experienced strategist.</p>

<p>These elaborate works had been constructed in the course of a year by
thousands of Portuguese labourers, directed by Colonel Fletcher of the
royal engineers, upon a plan carefully thought out and laid down by
Wellington himself. The first and principal chain of fortifications
stretched for nearly thirty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span> miles across the whole promontory between the
river Tagus and the sea, about twenty-five miles north of Lisbon. The
summits of hills were crowned with forts, their sides were escarped and
protected with earthworks, their gorges were blocked with redoubts, a
small river at the foot of them was made impassable by dams; in short, the
utmost advantage was taken of the defences provided by nature, and these
were supplemented by artificial entrenchments. Portuguese garrisons manned
the greater part of the batteries, armed with guns from the arsenals of
Lisbon; British troops were to occupy the most vulnerable points of
attack. There was a second and third range of fortifications behind the
first, in case these should be forced, but no such emergency arose. When
Mass&eacute;na had carefully inspected the stupendous barrier reared in front of
him, his well-trained eye recognised it as impregnable: he paused for some
weeks under semblance of blockading the British forces, while he was
really scouring the country for the means of feeding his own; but in
November he began to retreat upon Santarem, Almeida, and Ciudad Rodrigo,
with a half-starved and dispirited army, greatly reduced in numbers during
the campaign.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>The year 1811 was perhaps the least interesting, yet the most critical in
the history of the Peninsular war. Wellington had not escaped criticism at
home for allowing Mass&eacute;na to remain so long unmolested near Santarem. He
described himself in a private letter, written in December, 1810, as "safe
for the winter at all events". More he could not have said, knowing, as he
did, that Soult was in force before Cadiz, and might at any moment join
Mass&eacute;na. This, in fact, he did; leaving his fields of plunder in Andalusia
under the positive orders of Napoleon, he defeated the Spaniards at the
Gebora on February 19, and captured Badajoz, as well as Olivenza. In his
absence, Sir Thomas Graham, who commanded the British troops at Cadiz,
sailed thence with La Pe&ntilde;a, the Spanish commander, and a combined force of
about 12,000 men, to make a flank march, and attack the French besiegers,
under Victor, in the rear. A brisk action followed at Barrosa, in which
Graham obtained a complete victory, but the Spanish troops, as usual,
remained almost passive; the beaten army was not pursued,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span> and the siege
of Cadiz was not raised. This city was still the seat of the Spanish
national government, but the feeble junta had been superseded by a
national cortes, fairly representative of the nation, which passed some
liberal measures, and dissolved the so-called regency which assumed to
represent Ferdinand.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>FUENTES D'ONORO AND ALBUERA.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_78" id="TOPIC_78"></a>The two great frontier fortresses of Spain, Ciudad Rodrigo and Badajoz,
were now in the hands of the French. Mass&eacute;na had regained the Spanish
frontier in March, after frequent combats with the pursuing enemy, and
with heavy losses in men and horses, though he saved every gun except one.
This retreat involved the evacuation of every place in Portugal except the
fortress of Almeida. Wellington's pursuit would have been still more
vigorous, but that his Portuguese troops were half-starved, and had lost
discipline under intolerable privations. His next design seems to have
been the recapture of the fortresses, but he was not without ulterior
hopes&mdash;all too premature&mdash;of afterwards pushing on to Madrid and operating
in the eastern provinces of Spain. He first invested Almeida, and, leaving
General Spencer to continue the blockade, proceeded to Elvas in order to
concert measures with Beresford for the siege of Badajoz. Thence he was
suddenly recalled northward to repel a fresh advance of Mass&eacute;na, strongly
reinforced, for the relief of Almeida. The battle which followed at
Fuentes d'O&ntilde;oro, south-east of Almeida, was among the most hardly
contested struggles in the whole Peninsular war. It began on May 3, and,
with a day's interval, concluded on the 5th. The British remained masters
of the field, and claimed a somewhat doubtful victory, which at least
secured the evacuation of Almeida. The garrison of that fortress blew it
up by night, and succeeded, by masterly tactics, in joining the main
French army with little sacrifice of life.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_79" id="TOPIC_79"></a>Wellington returned to Badajoz, only to meet with disappointment. General
Cole, acting under Beresford, had retaken Olivenza; but Soult, with a
force of 23,000 men, was marching to succour Badajoz, when he was
encountered by Beresford at Albuera. Beresford's force was numerically
stronger than Soult's, but only 7,000 men were English, the rest being
mostly Spanish. Measured by the proportion of losses to men engaged on
both sides, this fight on May 16, 1811, must rank among the bloodiest on
record. In four hours<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span> nearly 7,000 of the allies and 8,000 French were
struck down. The decisive charge of the reserve was inspired and led by
Hardinge, afterwards Governor-General of India; the French were routed,
and Soult was checked, but little was gained by the victors.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> The siege
of Badajoz, indeed, was renewed, but its progress was slow for want of
proper engines and artillery, and it was abandoned, after two futile
attempts, on June 11. By this time, Marmont had succeeded Mass&eacute;na, and was
carrying out Napoleon's grand plan for a junction with Soult's army and a
fresh irruption into Portugal. With marvellous audacity, Wellington
offered battle to both marshals, who, happily ignorant of his weakness,
declined it more than once. In truth, he was never more nearly at the end
of his resources than when he went into winter quarters at the close of
1811, having failed to prevent Marmont from provisioning Ciudad Rodrigo,
and having narrowly escaped being overwhelmed by a much superior force.
His army was greatly reduced by sickness, he was very ill-supplied from
England, and he received no loyal support from the Portuguese government.
Moreover, the French had apparently extended their hold on Spain, both in
the eastern and northern provinces, while it was reported that Napoleon
himself, not content with dictating orders from afar, would return to
complete the conquest of the Peninsula.</p>

<p>At this juncture, he must have been cheered by the arrival of so able a
lieutenant as Graham from Cadiz, and by the brilliant success of Hill
against a detached body of Marmont's army south of the Tagus. There were
other tendencies also secretly working in favour of the British and their
allies. Joseph Bonaparte, as King of Spain, openly protested against the
extortions which he was enjoined to practise on his subjects, and went so
far as to resign his crown at Paris, though he was induced to resume it.
Again the broken armies of the Spanish had reappeared in the form of
guerilla bands under leaders such as Mina; they could not be dispersed,
since they had no cohesion, and were more formidable through their extreme
mobility than organised battalions. Above all, the domination of France
over Europe was already undermined and tottering invisibly to its fall.
The Tsar Alexander had, as we have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span> seen, been deeply offended by the
preference of an Austrian to a Russian princess, as the consort of
Napoleon, and still more by his imperious annexation of Oldenburg. Sweden,
following the example of Russia, had begun to rebel against the
continental system. A series of internal reforms had aroused a national
spirit, and stealthily created the basis of a national army in Prussia,
and the intense hostility of all North Germany to France was thinly
disguised by the unwilling servility of the Prussian court. Napoleon, who
seldom laboured under the illusions propagated by his own manifestoes and
bulletins, well knew what he was doing when, in August, 1811, he allowed
himself to burst into a storm of indignation against the Russian
ambassador at the Tuileries. From that moment he clearly premeditated a
rupture with Russia, and soon he withdrew 60,000 of his best troops from
Spain, to be employed in that fatal enterprise of 1812 which proved to be
his doom.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CAPTURE OF CIUDAD RODRIGO AND BADAJOZ.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_80" id="TOPIC_80"></a>The winter of 1811-12 was spent by Wellington in preparing, with the
utmost secrecy, for the sieges of Ciudad Rodrigo and Badajoz, as the first
steps in an offensive campaign. In January, 1812, he struck a sudden blow
against the former, and captured it by an assault, attended with great
carnage, on the 19th of that month. In this furious conflict, lasting but
half an hour, Craufurd, the renowned leader of the light division, fell
mortally wounded. Shameful excesses sullied the glory of a splendid
exploit. Marmont immediately drew in his troops towards Salamanca, leaving
Soult in the valley of the Tagus; and Hill, with his southern army, moved
northward. Wellington, who was created an earl in February, transferred
the greater part of his troops to Badajoz, and began a regular siege, but
with very imperfect materials, no organised corps of sappers and miners,
and very few officers skilled in the art of taking fortified towns. He was
greatly delayed on the route by the lack of transport, and the vexatious
obstinacy of the Portuguese authorities, while time was of the utmost
consequence lest any or all of three French armies should come to raise
the siege. Hence the extreme rapidity of his final operations.</p>

<p>After the capture of an outlying fort, three breaches were made in the
walls, and on the night of April 6, under the cover of thick darkness, two
divisions of British troops descended<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span> into the ditch, many carrying
ladders or sacks of hay, and advanced to the foot of the <i>glacis</i>. Here
they were almost overwhelmed with a hurricane of fiery missiles, and in
mounting the breaches they had to face not only hand-grenades, trains of
powder, and bursting shells, but a <i>chevaux-de-frise</i> of sabre-blades
crowning the summit. None of these attacks was successful; but another
division under Picton scaled the castle, and a brigade under Walker
effected an entrance elsewhere. After this, the French abandoned the
breaches; the resistance waxed fainter, and at six in the morning,
Philippon, the governor, with his brave garrison, surrendered
unconditionally. The loss of the British and Portuguese in killed and
wounded was stated at the enormous figure of 4,885, and it was avenged by
atrocities prolonged for two days and nights, worse than had followed the
storming of Ciudad Rodrigo. Wellington ordered the provost marshal to
execute any soldiers found in the act of plunder, but officers vainly
attempted to check their men at the peril of their own lives.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>SALAMANCA.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_81" id="TOPIC_81"></a>It had been the intention of Wellington to operate next against Soult, and
drive him, if possible, from Esdremadura and Andalusia. But, as appears
from one of his despatches to Lord Liverpool, he was ill satisfied with
the conduct of his allies guarding Ciudad Rodrigo, and returned to resume
command in that region. In the same despatch he complains bitterly of the
niggardly policy of his government in regard to money and supplies. The
same timidity on the part of ministers at home appears in a letter from
Liverpool, almost forbidding him to accept the command-in-chief of the
Spanish armies, which, however, was conferred upon him later in this
year.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> At present, he decided to march against Marmont in the plains of
Leon. This movement was facilitated by the success of Hill in surprising a
body of French troops, and seizing the important bridge of Almaraz over
the Tagus on May 19, thereby breaking the French lines of communication
and isolating Marmont's army for a time. Soon afterwards, Salamanca and
its forts were captured by Wellington, but Marmont proved a very
formidable opponent, and, having behind him another army under King
Joseph, threatened the British<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span> lines of communication. In the series of
man&oelig;uvres which ensued, Wellington's forces met with more than one
reverse, but the French marshal was determined to win a victory on a large
scale. Wellington had no wish to risk a battle, unless Salamanca or his
own rear should be seriously threatened, and he stood on the defensive, a
little south of Salamanca, with Marmont's army encamped in front of him.</p>

<p>Early on July 22, the French seized one of two hills called the Arapiles
which formed the key of the position and commanded the road to Ciudad
Rodrigo. Marmont then organised complicated evolutions, of which the
ultimate object was to envelop the British right and cut off its expected
retreat. To accomplish this, he extended his own left so far that it
became separated by a gap from his centre. No sooner did Wellington, with
a flash of military insight, perceive the advantage thus offered than he
flung half of his troops upon the French left wing, and made a vigorous
attack with the rest upon the French centre. It was too late for Marmont,
himself wounded, to repair the mistake, the centre was driven in, and, as
was said, 40,000 men were beaten in forty minutes. General Clausel, who
took Marmont's place, showed great ability in the retreat, but the French
army could scarcely have escaped destruction had not the Spaniards, who
were entrusted with a post on the river Tormes, left the passage open for
the flying enemy. Nevertheless, the battle of Salamanca was the greatest
and most decisive yet fought by the British in the Peninsula; it
established the reputation of our army, and placed Wellington in the first
rank of generals. Three weeks later he entered Madrid in triumph, and was
received with the wildest popular acclamations. Joseph once more abandoned
his capital, joined Suchet in Valencia, and ordered Soult against his will
to withdraw from Andalusia and move in the same direction. This
concentration relieved Wellington from immediate anxieties, but exposed
him to a serious danger of being confronted before long by forces thrice
as great as his own. He also needed reinforcements, and was in still
greater want of money.</p>

<p>To students of military history it may seem a very doubtful question
whether, under such circumstances, it was prudent to advance farther into
Spain from his strongholds on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span> Portuguese frontier. But Wellington,
who had been created a marquis on August 18, judged it necessary to crush
if possible the remainder of Marmont's army which had retired northward
under Clausel. He therefore left Hill with a detachment to cover Madrid,
and marching through Valladolid occupied the town of Burgos. The castle of
that place remained in the hands of a French garrison 2,000 strong and had
been carefully fortified. Here again we may be permitted to doubt whether,
after the experience gained at Ciudad Rodrigo and Badajoz, Wellington did
wisely in resolving to invest and storm a fortress so formidable, without
an adequate siege-train, and with the knowledge that Clausel might rally
his forces in time to relieve it. Wellington himself afterwards admitted
to Liverpool that he had erred in not taking with him the best of his own
troops, and that he did not possess the means of transporting ordnance and
military stores from Madrid and Santander, where there was abundance of
them. The siege lasted a month, from September 19 to October 18; the
garrison offered a most obstinate resistance, inflicting great loss on the
besiegers by sorties, and in the end the attack failed. Souham, with
Clausel, was closing in upon Wellington from the north, Soult from the
south-east; Hill's position at Madrid was untenable, and another retreat
became inevitable. It was the last and most trying in Wellington's
military career. The army which had behaved nobly at Salamanca broke down
under the strain of suffering and depression, like that of Sir John Moore
before Coru&ntilde;a. The enemy was driven back in various rear-guard actions,
but on the march the sense of discipline vanished and shameful disorders
occurred. A scathing reprimand from Wellington, which might have been
written by a French critic and which ought never to have been made public,
threw all the blame of this disorganisation on the regimental officers,
and denied that any scarcity of provisions could be pleaded in excuse of
it.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>MILITARY REFORMS.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_82" id="TOPIC_82"></a>By the middle of November the campaign ended, and Wellington's
headquarters were at Ciudad Rodrigo. For the present, Spain was still
dominated by the French, but its southern provinces were clear of the
invaders, and elsewhere the tide was already on the turn. The Russian war
cast its shadow beforehand on the Spanish peninsula; the French<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span> army was
constantly weakened in numbers and still more in quality, as conscripts
were substituted for veterans, and inferior generals succeeded to high
commands; the Portuguese and Spanish contingents of the British army were
stronger and better disciplined. Wellington himself, tenacious of his
purpose as ever, received heartier support from home, where Liverpool had
become prime minister in June, and had been succeeded by Bathurst as
secretary for war and the colonies; and though the Marquis Wellesley, no
longer in the government, complained that his brother's operations had
been crippled by ministerial apathy, the Peninsular war, on the eve of its
completion, was adopted with pride and sympathy by the nation.</p>

<p>The last chapter of the Peninsular war opens with the operations
culminating in the battle of Vitoria, and closes with the battle of
Toulouse. Having accepted the office of generalissimo of the Spanish
armies, Wellington repaired to Cadiz during the winter of 1812-13, and
formed the lowest estimate of the make-shift government there carried on
under the dual control of the cortes and the regency. He failed to obtain
a reform of this system, but succeeded in effecting a reorganisation of
the Spanish army, to be in future under his own command. He next addressed
himself, with the aid of Beresford and the British minister at Lisbon, to
amend the monstrous abuses, civil and military, of Portuguese
administration. By the beginning of May, 1813, a great improvement was
visible in the equipment and <i>moral</i> of the Spanish and Portuguese troops;
a vigorous insurrection against the French occupation had broken out in
the province of Biscay, endangering the great road into Spain; and an
Anglo-Sicilian army of 16,000 men, under Sir John Murray, had repulsed
Suchet, hitherto undefeated, at Castalla on the Valencian coast, without,
however, completing their victory, or capturing any of the French guns in
the narrow defile by which the enemy fled. The want of unity in the
command of the French army, and of harmony between its generals, was more
felt than ever now that Napoleon's master-mind was engrossed in retrieving
the awful ruin of the Russian expedition.</p>

<p>Yet Napoleon's instructions to Joseph show that he had fully grasped the
critical nature of the situation. He enjoined Joseph to mass all his
forces round Valladolid, and imperatively directed that at all hazards the
communications with France should be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span> maintained. The Spanish guerillas
had long rendered communications so insecure that couriers with despatches
had to be escorted by bodies of 250 cavalry or 500 infantry; they were now
so effectually intercepted that Napoleon's own despatch reached Joseph
more than two months late, by way of Barcelona and Valencia. Meanwhile,
Joseph was openly accusing Soult, in a letter to his brother, of criminal
ambition&mdash;a charge to which he laid himself open before in Portugal&mdash;and
did not hesitate to add, "the Duke of Dalmatia or myself must quit Spain".
In England, on the contrary, parties were at last united in the desire to
bring the war to a triumphant end, and parliament grudged neither men nor
money to aid Wellington's plan of campaign. It was, then, under happier
auspices than in former years that he broke up from his cantonments then
stationed on the Coa, a little to the north-west of Ciudad Rodrigo, and
set forward with 70,000 British and Portuguese troops, besides 20,000
Spaniards, to drive the French out of Spain. So confident was he of
success that, as Napier relates, he waved his hand in crossing the
frontier on May 22, and exclaimed, "Farewell, Portugal".<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>VITORIA.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_83" id="TOPIC_83"></a>He advanced by the valley of the Douro; then, turning to the north-east,
he compelled the French to evacuate Burgos, and passed the Ebro on June
13. Graham in command of his left wing there joined him, after forcing his
way by immense efforts across the mountains of the Portuguese frontier.
Hill, commanding the right wing of his composite but united army, was
already with him. A depot for his commissariat and a military hospital
were established at Santander, where a British fleet was lying, and whence
he could draw his supplies direct from home. The French army, under Joseph
and Marshal Jourdan, fell back before him by a forced night march on the
19th and took up its position in front of Vitoria, in the province of
Biscay. Here, on the plain of the river Zadorra, was fought on the 21st
the greatest battle of the Peninsular war. Wellington had encountered
serious physical difficulties in his passage from the valley of the Ebro
to that of the Zadorra; but for once his plans had been executed with
admirable precision, and all his troops arrived at the appointed time on
the field of battle. The French, conscious of their impending expulsion
from Spain, were encumbered by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span> enormous baggage-trains containing the
fruits of five years' merciless spoliation "not of a province but of a
kingdom," including treasures of art from Madrid and all the provincial
capitals, with no less than 5,500,000 dollars in hard cash, besides two
years' arrears of pay which Napoleon had sent to fill the military chest
of Joseph's army. A vast number of vehicles, loaded with the whole
imperial and royal treasure, overspread the plain and choked the great
road behind the French position, by which alone such a mass of waggons
could find its way into France.</p>

<p>The French army consisted of about 60,000 men, with 150 pieces of cannon,
but strong detachments, under Foy and Clausel respectively, had been sent
away to guard the roads to Bilbao and Pamplona. The British army numbered
nearly 80,000, inclusive of Portuguese and Spanish, with 90 guns. The
French were posted on strong ground, and held the bridges across the
river. Graham, with the left column of the British, made a circuit in the
direction of Bilbao, working round to cut off the French rear on the
Bayonne road. Hill, with the right column, forced the pass of Puebla, in
the latter direction, carried the ridge above it after much hard fighting,
and made good his position on the left flank of the French. Wellington
himself, in the centre, under the guidance of a Spanish peasant, pushed a
brigade across one of the bridges in his front, weakly guarded, and thus
mastered the others; his force then expanded itself on the plain and bore
down all opposition. Graham had met with a more obstinate resistance from
the French right, under Reille, but at last got possession of the great
Bayonne road. Thenceforward a retreat of the French army, partly
encircled, became inevitable, but it was conducted at first in good order
and with frequent halts at defensible points. The only outlet left open
was the mountain road to Pamplona, and this was not only impracticable for
heavy traffic but obstructed by an overturned waggon. The orderly retreat
was soon converted into a rout; the flying throng made its way across
country and over mountains towards Pamplona, leaving all the artillery,
military stores, and accumulated spoils as trophies of the British
victory.</p>

<p>The value of these was prodigious, but the great mass of booty, except
munitions of war, fell into the hands of private<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span> soldiers and
camp-followers. Wellington reported to Bathurst that nearly a million
sterling in money had been appropriated by the rank and file of the army,
and, still worse, that so dazzling a triumph had "totally annihilated all
order and discipline".<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> The loss in the battle had been about 5,000,
but Wellington stated that on July 8 "we had 12,500 men less under arms
than we had on the day before the battle". He supposed the missing 7,500,
nearly half of whom were British, to be mostly concealed in the mountain
villages.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> A large number of stragglers afterwards rejoined their
colours, but too late to aid in an effectual pursuit of the enemy. The
immediate consequence of this great victory was the evacuation by the
French of all Spain south of the Ebro. Even Suchet abandoned Valencia and
distributed his forces between Tarragona and Tortosa. To his great credit,
Wellington addressed to the cortes an earnest protest against wreaking
vengeance on the French party in Spain, many of whom might have been
driven into acceptance of a foreign yoke "by terror, by distress, or by
despair". At the same time, he vigorously followed up his success by
chasing and nearly surrounding Clausel's division, while Hill invested
Pamplona, and Graham drove Foy across the Bidassoa, in his advance upon
the fortress of St. Sebastian.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE BATTLE OF THE PYRENEES.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_84" id="TOPIC_84"></a>The fortifications of St. Sebastian were in a very imperfect condition,
but the governor, Emmanuel Rey, was nevertheless able to defend the place
with success. Wellington, after laying siege to it, sanctioned a premature
attempt to scale the breaches which cost Graham's force a loss of more
than 500 men. This check was succeeded by another, still more serious, in
the historic pass of Roncesvalles. Napoleon, hearing at Dresden of the
battle of Vitoria, and instantly fathoming its momentous import,
despatched Soult, as "lieutenant of the emperor," to assume command of all
the French armies at Bayonne and on the Spanish frontier, still amounting
nominally to 114,000 men, besides 66,000 under Suchet in Catalonia. Soult
reached Bayonne on July 13, fortified it strongly, and reorganised his
troops with amazing energy, inspiriting them with a warlike address in the
well-known style of Napoleon's proclamations. On the 25th he set his
forces in motion, with the intention of crushing the British right by a
sudden irruption, and relieving Pamplona.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span> He all but achieved his object,
for, by well-concerted and well-concealed movements, he actually carried
the passes of Roncesvalles and Maya, in spite of a gallant resistance and
the French troops were on the point of pouring down the Pyrenees on the
Spanish side, when Wellington arrived at full speed from his position
before St. Sebastian.</p>

<p>He was opportunely reinforced, and gave battle on the rugged heights in
front of Pamplona to a force numerically superior, but for the most part
charging uphill. Never, even at Bussaco, did the French show greater
ardour and <i>&eacute;lan</i> in attack, and it was only after a series of bloody
hand-to-hand combats on the summits and sides of the mountains that they
were compelled to recoil and rolled backward down the ridge. Baffled in
his attempt to relieve Pamplona, Soult turned westwards towards St.
Sebastian, but was anticipated by Wellington, and faced by three divisions
of Hill on his right. A second engagement followed, in which the
Portuguese earned the chief honours, and 3,000 prisoners were taken. At
last Soult gave orders for a retreat, and in the course of it was all but
entrapped in a narrow valley where he could not have escaped the necessity
of surrender. It is said that he was warned just in time by the sudden
intrusion of three British marauders in uniform; at all events, he
instantly changed his line of march, and ultimately led his broken army
back to France, but in the utmost confusion, and not without fresh
disasters. One of these befell Reille's division in the gorge of Yanzi,
and another the French rear-guard under Clausel, which defended itself
valiantly, but was driven headlong down the northern side of the Pyrenees
from which this series of battles derives its name.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_85" id="TOPIC_85"></a>The siege of St. Sebastian was immediately renewed with a far more
powerful battering train, but its defences had also been strengthened by
the indefatigable governor. The final assault took place on August 31, and
rivalled the storming of Badajoz in the murderous ferocity of the <i>mel&eacute;e</i>
at the breaches, as well as in the horrors practised on the inhabitants by
the victorious assailants, which Wellington and Graham vainly endeavoured
to check. So desperate was the defence, and so insuperable appeared the
obstacles to an entrance by the breaches, that Graham adopted the heroic
expedient of causing his artillery to fire a few feet only over the heads
of the forlorn<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span> hope, until a clear opening had been made, and deadly
piles of combustibles had been exploded behind the main breach, blowing
into the air 300 of the garrison. A hideous conflagration destroyed the
greater part of the town. A few days later the castle, to which the
governor had retired, yielded to an irresistible cannonade, and he
surrendered at discretion with about 1,200 men. Several hundred wounded,
including a large number of British prisoners, were found there in the
hospitals.</p>

<p>On the 30th, the day before St. Sebastian was stormed, Soult attempted a
diversion for its relief by crossing the Bidassoa, and on the following
day he engaged a large body of Spaniards at St. Marcial. On this occasion
Wellington held the British troops in reserve, and the Spaniards without
their aid defeated the French with great slaughter. So ended a
well-planned and well-executed effort to reconquer the Spanish frontier.
Pamplona was still untaken, and Suchet was still in Catalonia, but no
further offensive movement was undertaken by the French against Spain.
Both Soult and Wellington had shown remarkable powers of generalship, and
there was a moment when Soult might have snatched the prize of victory by
raising the siege of Pamplona. But his ultimate success was hopeless, and
his failure was complete. Before the fall of St. Sebastian and the battle
of St. Marcial, Wellington estimated the French losses at 15,000 men, who
could ill be spared in the interval between Napoleon's last gleam of
victory at Dresden and on his signal defeat at Leipzig.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>WELLINGTON ENTERS FRANCE.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_86" id="TOPIC_86"></a>But the Peninsular war, in the historical sense, was not yet over. During
the summer of 1813 a mixed force of British, Germans, Spaniards, and
Sicilians had been carrying on an intermittent war against the French
under Suchet in the eastern provinces. Their commander, Sir John Murray,
who had allowed the beaten enemy to escape at Castalla, proved equally
irresolute in an attempt to capture Tarragona, countermanded the assault,
and re-embarked his troops on the approach of Suchet. Soon afterwards he
was superseded by Lord William Bentinck, and Suchet after the battle of
Vitoria was compelled to retire behind the Ebro. Bentinck renewed the
investment of Tarragona, but permitted Suchet without a battle to relieve
it, demolish its fortifications, and withdraw its garrison at the end of
August. An ill-judged advance of the British general<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span> into Catalonia
brought about another misfortune, and, upon the whole, the series of
operations conducted against Suchet were by no means glorious to British
arms or generalship, however important their effect in preventing a large
body of French veterans from reinforcing Soult's army at a critical time
in the Western Pyrenees. Wellington himself inclined to complete the
deliverance of Spain by clearing the province of Catalonia of the
invaders, but the British government, having in view the prospect of
crushing Napoleon in Germany, urged him to undertake an immediate invasion
of France. Accordingly he moved forward on October 7, leaving Pamplona
closely blockaded, threw his army across the Bidassoa on the 8th by a
stroke of masterly tactics, forced the strong French lines on the north
side of it, and established himself on the enemy's soil. Before entering
France he issued the most stringent proclamations against plundering,
which he enforced by the sternest measures, and announced that he would
not suffer the peaceful inhabitants of France to be punished for the
ambition of their ruler. On the 31st the French garrison of Pamplona,
despairing of relief, surrendered as prisoners of war.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_87" id="TOPIC_87"></a>The prolonged defence of Pamplona gave Soult time to strengthen his
position on the Nivelle. The lines which he constructed rivalled those of
Torres Vedras, and the several actions by which they were at last forced
and turned were among the most desperate of the whole war. The first was
fought in the early part of November, and resulted in the occupation by
Wellington's army of the great mountain-barrier south of Bayonne, with six
miles of entrenchments along the Nivelle, and of the port of St. Jean de
Luz. A month later Wellington became anxious to establish his
winter-cantonments between the Nive and the Adour, partly for strategical
reasons, and partly in order to command a larger and more fertile area for
his supplies. On December 9, therefore, Hill with the right wing forded
the Nive and drove back the French left upon their camp in front of
Bayonne. Then followed three most obstinate combats on the 10th, 11th and
13th, in which Soult took the offensive, with Bayonne as the centre of his
operations, and with the advantage of always moving upon interior lines
resting upon a strong fortress. In the first of these attacks, he
surprised and nearly succeeded in overwhelm<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>ing the British left, under
Hope, now Sir John, before Wellington could bring other divisions to its
support. In the second, he fell suddenly on the same troops, exhausted by
fatigue, and still more or less isolated, but they were rallied by Hope
and Wellington in person, and remained masters of the field. In the third
he concentrated his whole strength upon the British right under Hill,
aided by a thick mist, and by a flood upon the Nive, which swept away a
bridge of boats, and separated Hill from the rest of the army.
Nevertheless, that able general, emulating the noble example of Hope in
the earlier encounters, succeeded in repelling assault after assault,
until Wellington himself appeared with reinforcements of imposing
strength, and converted a stubborn defence into a victory.</p>

<p>The loss of the allies since crossing the Nive had exceeded 5,000; that of
the French was 6,000, besides 2,400 Germans who deserted to the British
during the night of the 9th in obedience to orders from home. Ever since
he assumed the command Soult had shown military ability of a rare order.
Bayonne, the base of all his operations, was indefensible before he
fortified it. A great proportion of his troops were raw conscripts, or
demoralised by defeat, before he inspired them with his own courage and
vigour. He was practically dependent for subsistence in his own country on
the very system of pillage which had roused a patriotic frenzy of
resentment in Spain and other lands ravaged by French armies. He now stood
at bay in the south of France, as Wellington had so long stood at bay in
Portugal, and continued there during the early part of 1814 a defensive
campaign not unworthy of comparison with the prodigious exploits of
Napoleon himself against the invaders of his eastern provinces.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE INVESTMENT OF BAYONNE.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_88" id="TOPIC_88"></a>A respite of two months succeeded the battles on the Nive. During this
interval Wellington's difficulty in paying his troops was great, owing to
the enormous drain of specie from England into Central Europe. He was
further embarrassed by the appearance of the Duke of Angoul&ecirc;me, elder son
of Charles, Count of Artois, afterwards Charles X., at his headquarters.
The British government was by no means committed to a restoration of the
Bourbons, and Wellington deprecated the duke's appearance as at least
premature. He therefore insisted upon his remaining incognito and as a
non-combatant at St.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span> Jean de Luz. Soult was in great straits, not only
because he was compelled to "make war support war" by exorbitant
requisitions upon the French peasantry, but also because the exigencies of
Napoleon were such that large drafts of the best troops were drawn from
the army of the south. When hostilities were resumed in the middle of
February, 1814, the Anglo-Portuguese and Spanish force combined
outnumbered the French by nearly five to three, but Soult retained the
decisive advantage of having a strong <i>point d'appui</i> in Bayonne at the
confluence of the Nive and Adour. Careful preparations were made by
Wellington for throwing a large force across the Lower Adour below
Bayonne, in concert with a British fleet. Contrary winds and a violent
surf delayed the arrival of the British gunboats, but on February 23 Hope
sent over a body of his men on a raft of pontoons in the face of the
enemy's flotilla, with the aid of a brigade armed with Congreve rockets,
which had been first used at Leipzig, and produced the utmost
consternation in the French ranks. The gunboats soon followed, but with
the loss of one wrecked and others stranded in crossing the bar. By the
joint exertions of soldiers and sailors a bridge was then constructed, by
which Hope's entire army with artillery passed over the river, and, two
days afterwards, began the investment of Bayonne.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the centre and right wing, under the command of Wellington, had
forced a passage across the Upper Adour and threatened Bayonne on the
other side. Leaving a garrison of 6,000 men in Bayonne, Soult took his
stand at Orthez, with an army of about 40,000 men, on the summit of a
formidable ridge. Wellington attacked this ridge on the 27th, with a force
of nearly equal strength in three columns so disposed as to converge from
points several miles distant from each other. The veterans of the French
army, admirably handled, fought with tenacity, and all but succeeded in
foiling the attack before Wellington could bring up his reserves. The
conscripts, however, were not equally steady, and when Hill, advancing
from the extreme right, pressed upon the French left, Soult's orderly
retreat became a precipitate flight. The French loss greatly exceeded the
British, and was soon afterwards swelled by wholesale desertions; the road
to Bordeaux was thrown open, and the royalist reaction against Napoleon,
stimulated by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span> the depredation of the French troops, ripened into a
general revolt.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Napoleon had lost Germany by the battle of Leipzig; early in
1814 the allied armies of Austria, Prussia, and Russia had entered France,
and a congress was being held at Ch&acirc;tillon-sur-Seine, to formulate, if
possible, terms of peace. The city of Bordeaux was the first to declare
itself openly in favour of the Bourbons. Wellington sent a large
detachment to preserve order, with strict instructions to Beresford, who
commanded it, to remain neutral, in the event of Louis XVIII. being
proclaimed, pending the negotiations with Napoleon at Ch&acirc;tillon. But the
excitement of the people could not be restrained, and the arrival of the
Duke of Angoul&ecirc;me evoked a burst of royalist enthusiasm which anticipated
by a few weeks only the abdication of Napoleon at Fontainebleau. The
defection of Bordeaux forced Soult to fall back rapidly on a very
formidable position in front of Toulouse. The British army followed in
pursuit, encumbered with a great artillery and pontoon train. After a
lively action at Tarbes, it arrived in front of Toulouse on March 27, to
find the Garonne in flood, and the French army strongly entrenched around
the town, with a prospect of being joined by 20,000 or 30,000 veterans,
under Suchet, from Catalonia.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE BATTLE OF TOULOUSE.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_89" id="TOPIC_89"></a>The dispositions of Wellington, ending in the battle of Toulouse, on April
10, have not escaped criticism. Hill, with two divisions and a Spanish
contingent, threw a bridge across the Garonne below Toulouse, but
discovered that he could make no progress in that direction, owing to the
impassable state of the roads. Beresford crossed the river with 18,000 men
at another point, but a sudden flood broke up the pontoon bridge in his
rear, and he remained isolated for no less than four days, exposed to an
attack from Soult's whole army. Having missed this rare opportunity, Soult
calmly awaited the attack, with a force numerically inferior, but with
every advantage of position. On the 10th Wellington's troops advanced in
two columns, separated from each other by a perilous interval of two
miles. One of these, including Freyre's Spaniards and Picton's division,
was fairly driven back after furious attempts to storm the ramparts of the
fortified ridge held by the French. Beresford, however, who in this battle
combined generalship<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span> with brilliant courage, restored the fortunes of the
day by a dashing advance against the redoubts on the French right. Having
carried these he swept along the ridge, which became untenable, and Soult
withdrew his army within his second line of defences. Two days later,
seeing that Hill menaced Toulouse on the other side, and fearing that if
defeated again he would lose his only line of retreat along the
Carcassonne road, he evacuated Toulouse by that route, leaving his
magazines and hospitals in the hands of the British army. By so doing he
left to Wellington the honour and prize of victory, but few victories have
been so dearly bought, and the loss in killed and wounded was actually
greater on the side of the victors than on that of the vanquished.</p>

<p>Toulouse received Wellington on the 12th with open arms, and as news
reached him on the same day announcing the proclamation of Louis XVIII. at
Paris, he no longer hesitated to assume the white cockade. Soult loyally
declined to accept the intelligence until it was officially confirmed,
when a military convention was made on the 18th, whereby a boundary line
was established between the two armies. Suchet had already withdrawn from
Spain, and at last recalled the garrisons from those Spanish fortresses in
which Napoleon had so obstinately locked up picked troops which he sorely
needed in his dire extremity. But on the 14th, a week after Napoleon's
abdication, the famous "sortie from Bayonne" took place, in which each
side lost 800 or 900 men, and Hope, wounded in two places, was made
prisoner. For this waste of life the governor of Bayonne must be held
responsible, since he was informed of the events at Paris by Hope, and
instead of awaiting official confirmation, like Soult, chose to risk the
issue of a night combat, which must needs be deadly and could not be
decisive.</p>

<p>Thus ended the Peninsular war. This war on the British side has seldom
been surpassed in the steady adherence to a settled purpose, through years
of discouragement and failure, maintained by the general whose name it has
made immortal. Neither his strategy nor his tactical skill was always
faultless; and afterwards in comparing himself with Soult, he is reported
to have said, that he often got into scrapes, but was extricated by the
valour of his army, whereas Soult, when he got into a scrape, had no such
men to get him out of it. However this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span> might be, Wellington's foresight
in appreciating the place to be filled by the Peninsular war in the
overthrow of Napoleon's domination, and his truly heroic constancy in
striving to realise his own idea will ever constitute his best claim to
greatness. No other man in England or in Europe discerned as he did, that
with Portugal independent and guarded by the power of Great Britain on its
western coast and its eastern frontier, the permanent conquest of Spain by
the French would become impossible. No one else saw beforehand, what
Napoleon discovered too late, that a war in Portugal and Spain would drain
the life-blood of his invincible hosts, and at length help towards the
invasion of France itself. No other general would have shown equal
statesmanship in managing Spanish juntas and controlling even Spanish
guerillas, or equal forbearance in sparing the French people the evils
which a victorious army might have inflicted upon them.</p>

<h3>THE DOWNFALL OF NAPOLEON.</h3>


<p>The war between France and Russia, publicly threatened in August,
1811,<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> was long deferred. On Russia's part the adherence to a defensive
policy delayed action until France was ready. But there was another reason
why the preparations for war were only slowly pushed forward. Even at the
court of St. Petersburg there was a French party which retarded such
preparations as committing Russia too definitely to an open rupture. On
the part of France, also, delay was necessary. Though deliberately
provoked by himself, the war was not altogether welcome to Napoleon. It
suited him best to have a strong but friendly neighbour in Russia, and
victory promised him but the half-hearted friendship of a power to which
he could no longer dare to leave much strength. Besides it was necessary
to make far more extensive preparations than had been required for any of
his previous campaigns. Russia was too poor and too thinly peopled for it
to be possible for war to support itself, and immense supplies with
correspondingly large transport arrangements were needed for a large army
which would have to fight at so vast a distance from its base. It would
have been impossible to be ready in time for a summer campaign in 1811;
the country was not favourable to transport on a large scale during
winter, and the war was therefore postponed till the summer of 1812. The
end of May or beginning of June was the date originally selected for the
beginning of operations, as it was expected that the difficulty of
providing fodder would be greatly reduced when the grass had grown. But
the preparations were not sufficiently advanced by that date, and
hostilities were only opened on June 24.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_90" id="TOPIC_90"></a>The interval was spent by both powers in securing allies and pacifying
enemies. Early in the year 1812 Prussia had made a last attempt to avert a
French alliance by inviting Russia to join in a peaceful compromise. After
the failure of this negotiation her position was helpless, and resembled
that of Poland before its national extinction. Russia could not become her
active ally without exposing her own army to destruction at a second
Friedland, and Prussia could not fight France alone. Frederick William,
therefore, accepted the terms dictated by Napoleon. By a treaty concluded
on February 24 he agreed to supply the emperor with 20,000 men to serve as
a part of the French army, and was to raise no levies and give no orders
without his consent. The king was also to afford a free passage and
provide food and forage for the French troops, payment for which was to be
arranged afterwards. In return for this a reduction was made in the war
indemnity due to France. This was probably as much as Napoleon could have
obtained without authorising a dangerous increase in the Prussian army.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>RUSSIAN ALLIANCES.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_91" id="TOPIC_91"></a>Austria was more fortunate, because an Austrian war would have been a
serious diversion, not a step towards the invasion of Russia. She was in
consequence able to impose her own terms on France. These terms, so far as
the nature and extent of the Austrian assistance to France were concerned,
had been sketched by Metternich to the British agent, Nugent, as far back
as November, 1811, and they were accepted by France in a treaty of March
16, 1812.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> Austria was to provide an army of 30,000 men to guard
Napoleon's flank in Volhynia. In return France guaranteed the integrity of
Turkey, and secretly promised a restoration of the Illyrian provinces to
Austria in exchange for Galicia, which was to form a part of a
reconstituted Poland. Elsewhere Napoleon's negotiations were unsuccessful.
In January he fulfilled his threat of occupying Swedish Pomerania, but it
had no effect on Swedish policy, and when in March he offered Finland and
a part of Norway as the price of an alliance, his terms were rejected and
Sweden allied herself with Russia. On April 17 Napoleon made overtures for
peace with Great Britain, offering to evacuate Spain and to recognise the
house of Braganza in Portugal and the Bourbons in Sicily, if the British<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
would recognise the "actual dynasty" in Spain and Murat in Naples. The
offer was certainly illusory. "Actual dynasty" was an ambiguous phrase,
but would naturally mean the Bonapartes. Castlereagh declined to recognise
Joseph, but declared his readiness to discuss the proposed basis if
"actual dynasty" meant a recognition of Ferdinand VII. in Spain. Napoleon
was enabled to say that his offers of peace had been rejected, and made no
answer to Castlereagh.</p>

<p>Russia in her turn had to conciliate the Porte, Sweden, Persia, and Great
Britain. The Turkish negotiations were prolonged, and it was only in May
that the treaty of Bucharest was signed, by which Russia gave up all her
conquests except Bessarabia. Sweden had offered Russia her alliance in
February. She was prepared to surrender Finland to Russia on condition
that Russia should assist her in the conquest of Norway. A joint army was
to effect this conquest and then make a descent on North Germany,
threatening the rear of the French army of invasion. The adhesion of Great
Britain was to be invited. On April 5 an alliance between Russia and
Sweden was signed on the terms suggested. This was followed on August 28
by the treaty of &Aring;bo, which was signed in the presence of the British
representative, Lord Cathcart. By this treaty Russia was to assist Sweden
with 30,000 men and a loan, Sweden undertook to support Russia's claim,
when it should be made, for an extension of her frontier to the Vistula.
Shortly afterwards it was agreed to postpone the attack on Norway till the
following year, and thus at length the Russian army in Finland was set
free. The treaties with the Porte and Sweden were too late to liberate
troops to oppose Napoleon's advance, but the troops thus liberated greatly
endangered his retreat. With Persia no peace could be made. Great Britain
was still nominally at war both with Russia and with Sweden. Negotiations
with Russia in April came to nothing because the British government
refused to take over a loan of &pound;4,000,000, but on July 18 a treaty of
alliance between the three powers was signed, in which Great Britain
promised pecuniary aid to Russia. A further sign of friendship was given
when the tsar handed over the Cronstadt fleet for safekeeping to the
British. The formal treaty was, however, only the public recognition of a
friendship and mutual confidence which had begun with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span> breach between
Russia and France. This good understanding was shared by the nominal
allies of France, Prussia and Austria. Russia was fully informed of the
military and political plans of Austria, and knew that her forces would
not fight except under compulsion.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_92" id="TOPIC_92"></a>At last, on June 24, Napoleon's grand army began the passage of the
Niemen, which formed the boundary between the duchy of Warsaw and the
Russian empire. The main body, at least 300,000 strong, was commanded by
Napoleon himself. A northern division, including the Prussian contingent,
was commanded by Macdonald, and, after advancing to Riga, which it
pretended to besiege, remained idle throughout the campaign. The
Austrians, under Schwarzenberg, formed a southern division, but they
merely man&oelig;uvred, and made no serious attempts to impede the movements
of the southern Russian army on its return journey from the war on the
Danube. Napoleon himself drove the main Russian armies before him in the
direction of Moscow. At last Kutuzov, who had taken over the command of
the Russians in the course of the retreat, made a stand at Borodino, where
on September 7 one of the bloodiest battles on record was fought. The
figures are variously given, but the French army probably lost over 30,000
in killed and wounded out of a force of 125,000; and the Russians lost not
less than 40,000 out of an army of slightly smaller dimensions. This awful
carnage ended, after all, in little more than a trial of strength. The
French gained the ground, but the Russians made good their retreat, and
six days later Kutuzov retired through the streets of Moscow, taking the
better part of the population and all the military stores with him. The
French vanguard entered on the 14th, and Napoleon himself next day. A
fire, kindled either by accident or by Russian incendiaries, raged from
the 14th to the 20th and destroyed three-fourths of the city.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>NAPOLEON'S RETREAT FROM MOSCOW.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_93" id="TOPIC_93"></a>The capture of Moscow was far from being the triumph that the French
emperor had anticipated. Deceived by his recollections of Tilsit, he had
fully counted upon receiving pacific overtures from Alexander or at least
upon his eager acceptance of conciliatory assurances from himself. But as
the weeks passed and the vision of negotiation with the Russians proved
illusory, retreat became inevitable. On the night of October 18 the French
army, now about 115,000 strong, evacuated Moscow.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span> Kutuzov, who was
stronger in cavalry, though perhaps still weaker in infantry, hung upon
its rear, and, while avoiding a pitched battle, was able to prevent
Napoleon from retreating by any other route than the now devastated line
of his advance. It has often been questioned whether Kutuzov did not
deliberately refrain from destroying the French army. He certainly
informed Sir Robert Wilson on one occasion that he did not wish to drive
Napoleon to extremities, lest his supremacy should go to the power that
ruled the sea. The remark may have been nothing more than an outburst of
ill-temper, but, whatever the motive, there can be no doubt as to the
policy adopted. The retreating French army suffered terrible hardships
from the cold, for which it was ill prepared. Twice it seemed on the point
of falling into the hands of the Russians; at Krasnoe 26,000 prisoners are
said to have been captured by Kutuzov's army, while at Borisov the
southern army under Chichagov and the army returning from Finland under
Wittgenstein joined hands, and disputed the French passage of the Berezina
on November 26-29. According to Chambray's calculation, the French army
numbered 31,000 combatants before the passage, of whom but 9,000 remained
on December 1. All the non-combatants had been left in the hands of the
enemy.</p>

<p>This was the last direct attack made by the Russians on the relics of the
grand army. But the worst ravages of the Russian winter had yet to come.
On December 3 the cold became intense. As the survivors of the expedition
dragged themselves homewards through the Polish provinces, they were met
by large bodies of reinforcements pouring in from the west; these
recruits, comparatively fresh, were at first appalled by the gaunt and
famine-stricken aspect of the returning veterans, but soon perished
themselves in nearly equal numbers. It is estimated that altogether only
60,000 men recrossed the frontier out of a total of 630,000, and in the
estimate of 60,000 is included Macdonald's division, which was exposed to
comparatively little hardship. That division with the Prussian contingent
began to fall back on December 19. On the 30th, however, the Prussians
were reduced to neutrality by the convention of Tauroggen, signed by the
Prussian commander, Yorck, with the Russians, without the sanction of his
government. Had Russia been in a condition to press onwards at once and
carry the war into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span> French territory, it is possible that Europe might
have been spared the misery and bloodshed of the next few years. But, for
the moment, her strength and resources were exhausted, nor was it until
months had elapsed that other nations, or even France herself, became
aware of the magnitude of the catastrophe which had overtaken Napoleon's
host. That he was able to rally himself after it, to carry the French
people with him, to enforce a new conscription, and to assume the
aggressive in the campaign of 1813, must ever remain a supreme proof of
his capacity for empire.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>DISPUTES WITH THE UNITED STATES.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_94" id="TOPIC_94"></a>In the year 1812 war broke out between Great Britain and the United
States. For a time the continental warfare had led to a great increase in
American commerce, which was free from the attacks of privateers and from
the restrictions which the opposing parties placed on one another.
Presently, however, both parties attempted to force the United States into
a virtual alliance with themselves. Orders in council on the one side and
imperial decrees on the other had, as we have seen, declared a blockade of
the ports of the continent of Europe and of Great Britain, and the United
States saw their commerce threatened with disabilities approximating to
those suffered by the belligerent powers. President Jefferson, who was
supported by the republican party, adhered to a policy of strict
neutrality, and prepared to suffer any commercial loss rather than be
drawn into an European war. The only action which he took was the defence
of the river mouths with a view to resisting any offensive movement. The
federalist party on the other hand were in favour of energetic action
against France, so as to secure English favour and the great commercial
privileges which the mistress of the seas could bestow. For a time no
hostilities resulted, but constant irritation was caused by the British
claim to a right of search and to the impressment of sailors of British
nationality found on American ships, while American ships accused of
infringing the blockade were seized by either of the European combatants.
To some extent the differences between Great Britain and the United States
depended on rival views of the law of allegiance. The British maintained
the doctrine <i>nemo potest exuere patriam</i>, and regarded all British-born
persons, unless absolved from their allegiance by the act of the
mother-country, as British subjects. The law of the United States, on the
other hand, per<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>mitted an alien to become a citizen after fourteen years'
residence, and previously to 1798 had required a residence of five years
only. In this way it often happened that sailors who had received the
American citizenship were impressed for service on British ships, and
sometimes sailors of actual American birth were impressed. But it was
impossible to justify the practice to which the Americans resorted of
receiving deserters of British nationality from British ships of war, who
were induced by offers of higher pay to transfer themselves to the
American service.</p>

<p>Jefferson at first preferred to coerce the European powers by retaliatory
legislation. As early as April, 1806, a law had been passed forbidding the
importation of certain British wares, but was suspended six weeks after it
came into operation. In June, 1807, irritation was intensified by the
incident of the <i>Leopard</i> and the <i>Chesapeake</i>. Five men, four of whom
were British born and one an American by birth, were known to have
deserted from the British sloop <i>Halifax</i>, lying in Hampton roads, and to
have taken service on an American frigate, the <i>Chesapeake</i>. After
application for their surrender had been made in vain to the magistrates
of the town of Norfolk, where the <i>Chesapeake's</i> rendezvous was, and to
the officer commanding the rendezvous, Vice-admiral Berkeley sent his
flagship, the <i>Leopard</i>, carrying fifty guns, with an order to the British
captains on the North American station to search the <i>Chesapeake</i> for
deserters from six ships named, including the <i>Halifax</i>, in case she
should be encountered on the high seas. The <i>Leopard</i> arrived in
Chesapeake bay in time to follow the <i>Chesapeake</i> beyond American waters,
and then made a demand to search for deserters. On the captain of the
<i>Chesapeake</i> refusing compliance, the <i>Leopard</i> opened fire. The
<i>Chesapeake</i> was not in a condition to make any effectual reply, and,
after receiving three broadsides, struck her flag. Only one of the
deserters from the <i>Halifax</i>, an Englishman, was found on the
<i>Chesapeake</i>; but three deserters from the British warship <i>Melampus</i>,
which had not been named in Berkeley's order, all Americans by birth, were
removed from the <i>Chesapeake</i>, which was now permitted to return to
port.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> Although the British government offered reparation for this
action, recalled Berkeley, and dis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>avowed the right to search ships of war
for deserters, the incident could not fail to make a bad impression on
American opinion.</p>

<p>But still Jefferson adhered to a policy of pacific coercion. In December,
1807, the act of April, 1806, was again put into force, and an embargo
act, passed by the American congress, now cut off all foreign countries
from trade with the United States. But the policy of embargo was
disastrous to its promoters. It ruined the commerce and emptied the
treasury of the United States. On March 1, 1809, a non-intercourse act,
applying only to France, Great Britain, and their dependencies, was
substituted for the embargo act.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> The new act enabled the president to
remove the embargo against whichever country should cancel its orders or
decrees against American trade. Three days later Jefferson was succeeded
by Madison as President of the United States. The change made no
difference to the policy of the United States government. But the
opposition was now much stronger and more violent than formerly; so much
so that Sir James Craig, the Canadian governor, actually despatched a spy,
John Henry, to sound the willingness of New England, where the federalist
party was the stronger, to secede from the union and join Great Britain
against the United States. This venture becomes the less surprising when
we observe that in the previous year, 1808, John Quincy Adams, the future
president, had predicted such a secession. Nothing, however, came of the
attempt. Madison attempted to obtain concessions from the British
government, but while the Perceval ministry lasted he met with no success.
In May, 1810, the non-intercourse act expired, but a proviso was enacted
that, if before March 3, 1811, either Great Britain or France should
cancel her decrees against American trade the act should, three months
after such revocation, revive against the power that maintained its
decrees. Madison was cajoled into believing that Napoleon had recalled his
decrees on November 1, 1810, and the non-intercourse act was accordingly
revived against Great Britain and her dependencies in February, 1811.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>WAR WITH THE UNITED STATES.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_95" id="TOPIC_95"></a>Almost the first act of the Liverpool administration was to cancel the
restrictions on American trade. But it was too<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span> late. Five days earlier
the United States had declared war against Great Britain on June 18, 1812.
The explanation of this step must be sought in the party politics of the
United States. While the federalists courted British alliance, the younger
members of the republican party had conceived a hope of conquering Canada
as a result of a victorious war against Great Britain. This was the reply
of the national party in the United States to the action of the Canadian
governor. Madison knew the impracticability of such a step, but, finding
that he could only carry the presidential election of 1812 with the
support of this section of his party, he declared war. Great Britain, with
her best troops in the Peninsula, was in no condition to use her full
strength in America, but the United States were entirely unprepared for
war. Their treasury was still empty, and their army and navy were small,
while Canada generally was contented and loyal to the British crown. Upper
Canada was full of loyalists, who had been expelled from the revolted
colonies, and who with their descendants hated the men that had driven
them from their homes; lower Canada was half-French and had nothing in
common with the United States, while the Roman catholic clergy threw the
whole weight of their influence on the British side. General Hull, who
commanded the forces employed against Canada, succeeded in crossing the
river Detroit in July and threatened the British post of Malden. But an
alliance with the Indians enabled the British first to possess themselves
of Mackinac, at the junction of lakes Huron and Michigan, and afterwards
to imperil Hull's communications through the Michigan territory.</p>

<p>Hull accordingly fell back on Detroit. The British, with 750 men under
Major-General Brock, together with 600 Indians, now prepared to attack
Hull at that place. Hull, who believed his retreat to be cut off by the
Indians, did not await the British attack, but surrendered on August 16
with 2,500 men and thirty-three guns. The effect of the capitulation was
to place the British in effectual possession, not merely of Detroit, but
of the territory of Michigan, and thus to render any attack on Canada from
that quarter extremely difficult. The advantages gained by the British
through this success were unfortunately neutralised by the policy pursued
by Sir George Prevost, who had succeeded Craig as governor of Canada.
Prevost was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span> of opinion that, when the news of the withdrawal of the
orders in council reached Washington, the United States government would
be ready to abandon hostilities; and he accordingly concluded a
provisional armistice with General Dearborn, the commander-in-chief of the
enemy's forces in the northern states. But President Madison, having
engaged in war, was anxious to try the effect of another attack on Canada
before negotiating for peace, and therefore declined to ratify the
armistice. The interval enabled the United States to bring up
reinforcements, but their new army failed in an attack on a British post
on the Maumee river.</p>

<p>Meanwhile a second attempt was made to invade Upper Canada, this time from
the side of Niagara. On October 13, Brigadier-General Wadsworth, acting
under the orders of General Van Rensselaer, led an attack on the British
position of Queenstown on the Canadian bank of the Niagara river. Brock
commanded the defence, but was killed early in the fight. The position was
momentarily seized by the enemy, but was presently recaptured by the
British, who had in the meantime been reinforced by Major-General Sheaffe,
the son of a loyalist, with a force from Fort George, and before the day
closed Wadsworth found himself compelled to surrender with 900 men. The
remainder of the enemy's forces, consisting of militia, rather than exceed
their military obligations by crossing the frontier, chose to leave these
men to their fate. In spite of the ignominious surrenders with which the
first two expeditions against Canada had terminated, a third attempt was
made by Brigadier-General Smyth to force the Canadian frontier; but on
November 28 he was repulsed with loss by the British under Bishopp between
Chippewa and Fort Erie, above the Niagara Falls, and at the end of the
year the Canadian frontier still remained unpierced.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>AMERICAN SUCCESSES AT SEA.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_96" id="TOPIC_96"></a>The glory of the British military successes was unfortunately obscured in
large measure by American successes on the sea. The maritime war resolved
itself into a series of fights between individual frigates. This was the
necessary result of the nature of the British force kept in American
waters. Ever since the renewal of hostilities with France in 1803 a
species of blockade had been maintained along the coast of the United
States by British vessels on the watch for deserters or contra<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>band of
war. It was also found necessary to employ ships of war to guard against
pirates in the West Indies and to protect British commerce in that quarter
against French privateers. For all these purposes speed was of more
importance than strength, and the British force in the west contained a
disproportionate number of smaller vessels as compared with line of battle
ships. The actual numbers of British warships in North American waters at
the beginning of 1812 were three ships of the line, twenty-one cruisers
and frigates, and fifty-three small craft. The United States navy was
still weaker, and amounted merely to seven efficient frigates and nine
small craft.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> There was no question of a contest between fleets, and
though the numbers of the British warships enabled them to destroy
American trade, they were ship for ship inferior to the American frigates,
which were thus enabled to win an empty glory in single-ship encounters.
The American frigates were, in fact, superior in every respect to the
British ships which nominally belonged to the same class. They were larger
and more strongly built, a frigate being as strong as a British
seventy-four. Their crews were more numerous, and were recruited entirely
from seamen, about one-third of whom would appear to have been of British
nationality, while, as has been seen, many of them had been decoyed from
British war-vessels by offers of higher pay. The British ships on the
other hand were manned largely by landsmen, often impressed from the
jails. A false economy had induced the British admiralty to impose narrow
limits on the use of ammunition for gunnery practice. The Americans on the
other hand were very liberal in this respect, with the result that in the
early years of the war they were greatly superior to their enemies in
point of marksmanship.</p>

<p>A good example of the disproportion between the British and American
frigates is furnished by the fight between the British frigate <i>Guerri&egrave;re</i>
and the American frigate <i>Constitution</i>, on August 19, one of the first
naval actions in the war. The <i>Guerri&egrave;re</i> was armed with twenty-four
broadside guns, discharging projectiles with a total weight of 517 pounds;
the <i>Constitution</i> with twenty-eight broadside guns, discharging a weight
of 768 pounds. The crew of the <i>Guerri&egrave;re</i>, counting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span> men only, numbered
244, that of the <i>Constitution</i> with a similar limitation 460. Finally the
<i>Guerri&egrave;re's</i> tonnage amounted to 1,092, as against the <i>Constitution's</i>
1,533. The <i>Guerri&egrave;re's</i> guns proved very ineffectual from the start,
while the marksmanship, not only of the American gunners but of the
riflemen in the <i>Constitution's</i> tops, was the wonder of the British. It
is stated that none of her shot fell short. After a fight lasting nearly
two hours the <i>Guerri&egrave;re</i> surrendered. The ship was a complete wreck, and
she had lost fifteen men killed and six mortally wounded as against seven
killed and three mortally wounded on board her opponent.</p>

<p>The effect of the engagement both on British and on American public
opinion was altogether out of proportion to its intrinsic importance. The
inequality in strength of the opposing frigates was not understood, and
any defeat of the mistress of the seas seemed an event of considerable
significance. The Americans soon met with other similar successes. On
October 18 their sloop <i>Wasp</i>, of eighteen guns, reduced the British sloop
<i>Frolic</i>, a weaker vessel, though of similar armament, to a helpless hulk
after a ten minutes' cannonade. The moral effect of this victory was not
impaired by the fact that the conqueror and her prize were compelled to
surrender a few hours later to the British seventy-four <i>Poictiers</i>. On
the 25th the <i>United States</i>, of forty-four guns, captured the
<i>Macedonian</i>, of thirty-eight, after three hours' fighting, and on
December 29 the British thirty-eight-gun frigate <i>Java</i>, with a very
inexperienced crew, was captured by the <i>Constitution</i> after a running
fight of three hours and a half.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE GERMAN CAMPAIGN OF 1813.</i></div>

<p>With the retreat of the French army from Russia the main scene of
operations on the continent was shifted from Russia to Germany. Great
Britain took little part in the actual warfare in Germany, and if she had
a larger share in the political negotiations which ultimately determined
the distribution of forces, still Austria and not Great Britain was the
power whose diplomacy had most effect on the course of events. The
upheaval of Europe against Napoleon, however, would have been much less
effective if it had not been supported by English<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span> subsidies, and Austria,
in the crippled state of her finances, would probably have had to remain
inactive if she had not been able to rely on English gold and perhaps
still more on English credit.</p>

<p>The campaign of 1813 falls naturally into three parts. During the first,
from the beginning of January to the latter part of April the victorious
Russians swept over North Germany, and, carrying the Prussian monarchy
with them, strengthened a reaction which had already begun against the
rule of Napoleon. The second part began with the arrival of Napoleon on
the scene of action towards the end of April and lasted to the conclusion
of an armistice on June 4. In this period of seven or eight weeks the
allies were forced to retire at all points and the war was carried into
Prussian territory. The armistice, which terminated on August 10, preceded
the opening of the third part of the campaign in which Russia and Prussia
were joined by Austria and Sweden, and, after gradually drawing closer
round the main French position in Saxony, finally inflicted a crushing
defeat upon Napoleon at Leipzig in the middle of October. The campaign was
virtually over when Napoleon secured his retreat by the victory of Hanau
on October 30; but it is impossible to sever it from the events outside
Germany which were directly occasioned by the downfall of Napoleon's
German domination. These are the revolt of Holland in November, that of
Switzerland in December, and the Austrian attack on Northern Italy in
October and November.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_97" id="TOPIC_97"></a>In the opening months of the campaign the movements were merely a sequel
to those of the previous year. The French retreat was continued from the
Niemen to the Vistula, the Elbe, and finally the Saale. The Russians
entered Prussia proper a few days after Yorck's capitulation, and the
French retired before them. Stein, the Prussian statesman who had received
a commission from Russia to administer the Prussian districts occupied by
her, ordered the provincial governor to convoke an assembly. Although some
indignation was felt at such a step being taken by Russian orders, the
assembly met and voted the formation of the Landwehr. In this way Prussia
actually began to arm against France, while the Prussian government still
professed to maintain the French alliance. A<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span> few days later King
Frederick William left Berlin, which was still occupied by the French, for
Breslau. Before the end of February he had concluded the treaty of Kalisch
with Russia, by which the two powers were to conduct the war against
France conjointly, and Russia was not to lay down her arms till Prussia
should be restored to a strength equal to that which she had possessed in
1806. On March 2 Cathcart arrived at Kalisch as British ambassador to the
Russian court. He actively promoted Russia's alliance with Prussia, from
which Great Britain stood apart for the present. He was able to obtain
from Prussia a renunciation of her claims on Hanover, but Frederick
William was still opposed to any increase of Hanoverian territory. On the
17th Prussia declared war on France. By that time the Russians had entered
both Berlin and Breslau, and had freed Hamburg from French dominion, thus
reopening Germany to British commerce. The declaration of war by Prussia
was accompanied by a convention with Russia providing for the deliverance
of Germany and the dissolution of the confederation of the Rhine. This
convention embodied Stein's policy. It relied on popular support and it
aimed at an unified government, at least in the territories occupied at
that date by adherents of France.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE GERMAN CAMPAIGN OF 1813.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_98" id="TOPIC_98"></a>But the popular upheaval in Germany was confined to the kingdom of
Prussia, and the attempt to spread it elsewhere only provoked distrust in
Austria and the South German states; it was not until the conservative
elements in Germany were won over by Metternich's policy that the
anti-Napoleonic movement became truly national. For the present Austria
played the part of mediator. Lord Walpole, who had been sent on a secret
errand to Vienna in December, 1812, tried in vain to win Austria to the
side of the allies by promising the restoration of the Tyrol, Illyria, and
Venetia.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> Her government would probably have preferred a reconciliation
with France, which would have arrested the growth of Russia and left
Germany divided, to a unified Germany such as Stein desired; but
Metternich, who directed her policy, cherished little hope of the success
of his endeavours, though he knew when to employ agents more optimistic
than himself. The Austrian<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span> treasury was empty, and it therefore suited
Austria to remain neutral as long as possible, while in the event of a
doubtful struggle this very neutrality would raise the price of her
ultimate alliance. It was in this way that she came at last to exercise a
decisive voice in the resettlement of Germany, not to say of Europe. True
to this policy, the Austrian court concluded a truce of indefinite
duration with Russia at the beginning of the year, and withdrew its forces
within its own borders. This was followed by an offer of mediation made to
France, which was, however, declined. A renewed offer was declined early
in April by both France and Great Britain. The British still distrusted
Austria, while France desired to buy her active co-operation and made an
offer of Silesia in return for an army of 100,000, should Prussia or
Russia open hostilities. Austria did not, however, abandon her project,
but notified Prussia and Russia that she would proceed with the task of
armed mediation, and steadily busied herself with military preparations.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_99" id="TOPIC_99"></a>The vigour of the Prussians in recruiting had surprised Napoleon, but his
own vigour was the marvel of Europe. In spite of the losses of the Russian
campaign, he was able to take the field at the end of April with an army
which at the lowest estimate was 200,000 strong. But his soldiers were for
the most part mere boys, and he was sadly deficient in cavalry. The
veterans of Austerlitz, of Jena, of Friedland, and of Wagram had been
recklessly sacrificed on the plains of Russia. He was victorious at L&uuml;tzen
on May 2, was joined by the King of Saxony, entered Dresden, and thence
pushed across the Elbe. On the 21st the victory of Bautzen enabled him to
advance to the Oder and occupy Breslau. A renewed offer of Austrian
mediation drew from him a declaration in favour of an armistice and a
diplomatic congress. On June 4 an armistice was actually concluded at
Poischwitz to last until August 1, and a neutral zone was provided to
separate the combatants. On June 7 the demands of Austria were presented
to Napoleon. They involved the renunciation by France of all territorial
possessions, and even of a protectorate in Germany, and the restoration to
Prussia and Austria of most of their lost provinces. Napoleon refused
these terms, but accepted the mediation of Austria, and arranged for a
congress which met at Prague in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span> the middle of July. The armistice was
prolonged till August 10. Both France and Austria were merely striving to
gain time while they prepared for war, and there can be no doubt that the
allies profited most by the delay. During the interval the news arrived of
Wellington's great victory at Vitoria on June 21, and Napoleon, recalled
to Mainz, occupied himself in arranging plans for the defence of the
Pyrenees.</p>

<p>During the armistice Prussia and Russia not only greatly reinforced their
troops, but received valuable assistance from Great Britain, Sweden, and
above all Austria. Already, on March 3, Great Britain had by the treaty of
Stockholm given her sanction to the seizure of the whole of Norway by
Sweden, after a vain attempt to induce Denmark to consent to a peaceable
cession of the diocese of Trondhjem. At the same time Great Britain
promised Guadeloupe as a personal gift to Bernadotte, and a subsidy of
&pound;1,000,000 for the Swedish troops fighting against Napoleon. A new treaty
between Russia and Sweden on April 22 guaranteed the cession of Norway. On
June 14 and 15 Cathcart, having at last obtained Prussia's consent to an
increase in the territories of Hanover, signed treaties at Reichenbach
with Prussia and Russia, by which Great Britain undertook to pay a subsidy
of two-thirds of a million pounds to the former and a million and a third
to the latter power. It was also agreed to issue federative paper notes to
an extent not exceeding &pound;5,000,000 to pay the expenses of the armies of
the two powers during the year 1813, and Great Britain undertook the
responsibility for one-half of these notes. Soon afterwards Austria
received a promise of a loan of &pound;500,000 as soon as she should join the
allies. Half of this last sum was actually paid within a few days of the
resumption of hostilities.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>DRESDEN AND LEIPZIG.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_100" id="TOPIC_100"></a>When the armistice expired, French forces were threatening Austria from
three sides&mdash;from Bavaria, Illyria, and Saxony; and Napoleon's intention
seems to have been to amuse the Austrian court with negotiations until he
could defeat the Prussian and Russian armies, after which he counted upon
overwhelming the Austrians with his entire force. The task of defeating
the Prussians was entrusted to his army in Saxony with which Davo&ucirc;t was
expected to co-operate from Hamburg, retaken by the French on May 30.
Austria, however, declared<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span> war on France the moment the armistice had
elapsed, August 12, and the main army of the allies, principally composed
of Austrians with large Prussian and Russian contingents, assembled in
Bohemia. Napoleon was opposed in Silesia by an army of Prussians and
Russians, while Bernadotte, in command of a mixed army, consisting mainly
of Swedes, Prussians and Russians, but including 3,000 British troops and
25,000 Hanoverians under Walmoden, operated against him from the north.
These three armies were eventually able to join hands, while Davo&ucirc;t's
army, the French armies in Italy and Illyria, and 170,000 French troops in
various German fortresses were unable to render effective aid in the
struggle. On August 26-27 Napoleon himself won the last of his great
victories at Dresden over the main army of the allies, while his
lieutenants were defeated by the northern army at Grossbeeren on August
23, and again at Dennewitz on September 6, and by the Silesian army at the
Katzbach on August 26. The capitulation of Vandamme at Kulm, with some
10,000 men, neutralised Napoleon's victory at Dresden, and his enemies
were increased by Austrian diplomacy. The treaty of Teplitz, concluded on
September 9, and accepted by Great Britain on October 3, committed the
allies to the complete independence of the several German states. On the
10th Bavaria renounced the French alliance, and on October 8, by the
treaty of Ried, she engaged to join the allies with 36,000 men, in return
for a promise that she should suffer no diminution of territory. On the
7th the northern and Silesian armies had united west of the Elbe;
Napoleon, who had quitted Dresden on the 6th and vainly attempted to
engage the separate northern army, arrived at Leipzig on the 14th. But it
was now too late.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_101" id="TOPIC_101"></a>On the 16th the allied armies, which had concentrated on Leipzig,
compelled him to stand at bay, and to risk all upon the fortunes of a
single battle. This battle, lasting three days, was not only one of the
greatest but one of the most decisive recorded in modern history, for it
finally crippled the warlike power of Napoleon, and inevitably determined
the issue of the campaigns yet to be fought in 1814 and 1815. It would
appear that Napoleon had under his command about 250,000 men, and that he
lost at least 50,000 in killed and wounded on the field. The allied forces
were much larger<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span> numerically, and their losses fully equalled those of
the French. But their victory was crushing. One of its immediate results
was that Napoleon was forced to abandon Saxony, and with it the French
cause in Germany. The French garrisons were reduced one by one. Of the
fortresses east of the Rhine, Hamburg, Kehl, Magdeburg, and Wesel alone
held out until the conclusion of peace in 1814. The general rising of
Central Europe against French domination which followed the battle of
Leipzig extended itself to Holland. The French were expelled in the middle
of November, and on December 2 the Prince of Orange was proclaimed
sovereign prince of the Netherlands. On the 29th the Swiss diet voted the
restoration of the old constitution. The confederation of the Rhine was
practically dissolved, but in Italy Napoleon's viceroy, Eug&egrave;ne
Beauharnais, after falling back before the Austrian army, was able to hold
the line of the Adige. On November 9 it was decided to offer peace to
Napoleon on condition of the surrender of all French conquests beyond the
Rhine, the Alps, and the Pyrenees. These terms represented the policy of
Metternich. The Earl of Aberdeen consented to them on behalf of Great
Britain and Nesselrode on behalf of Russia, but they were not accepted by
Napoleon before the date by which an answer was required, and the war
proceeded. On December 31 the Prussians under Bl&uuml;cher crossed the Rhine
near Coblenz and opened a new campaign.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>AMERICAN SUCCESSES.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_102" id="TOPIC_102"></a>Meanwhile the war on the American continent was carried on with varying
success, though the balance of fortune was rather on the side of the
United States. The operations were in the main of a desultory character,
no permanent conquests being made. The first engagement in the year 1813
was at Frenchtown on the Raisin River in Michigan, where Colonel Proctor,
commanding 500 regulars and militia, and 600 Indians, defeated an American
force of 1,000 under Brigadier-General Winchester, and took 500 prisoners,
while many of the remaining Americans fell into the hands of the Indians.
The immediate effect of this victory was that General Harrison, who was
leading an American force of 2,000 men against Detroit, determined to
retrace his steps. Three months later Proctor made a descent upon an
American position on the Maumee River in the north of the State of Ohio.
After besieg<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>ing the enemy for a few days he was compelled to retire, but,
before he left, an engagement took place on May 5, in which the British
forces, with a total loss of less than 100, inflicted severe losses on
their opponents and made about 500 prisoners. A subsequent attempt to
capture Fort Sandusky, near the head of Lake Erie, was repulsed on August
2; ninety out of 350 British troops were returned as killed, wounded or
missing.</p>

<p>The British had hitherto commanded the lakes, but Commodore Perry now
occupied himself in building a fleet at Presqu'isle in Pennsylvania on the
coast of Lake Erie. Commander Barclay, in command of such ships as the
British possessed, was badly supported and encountered the same
difficulties in obtaining seamen as had been experienced for the sea-going
ships. The ships in the service of the United States were in consequence
again the more powerful and the better manned. On September 10 the two
squadrons engaged. The British had six vessels with a broadside of 459
lb., while the enemy had nine vessels with a broadside of 928 lb. With
such odds the result could not be doubtful, and the whole British squadron
was compelled to surrender. This success enabled the enemy to strike with
effect at the south-western end of Lower Canada. The British immediately
evacuated the whole territory of Michigan with the exception of Mackinac;
and Proctor, now raised to the rank of major-general, commenced a retreat
in the direction of Lake Ontario. On October 5 he was attacked at
Moraviantown on the Thames by Harrison, and the greater part of his forces
were captured in an engagement which reflected small credit on British
generalship. The remainder of his forces reached Burlington Heights, at
the west end of Lake Ontario, but the whole country to the west of the
Grand River had to be abandoned to the enemy.</p>

<p>On Lake Ontario the fortune of war was more equally divided. The Americans
had been gradually collecting a naval squadron at Sackett's Harbour and
had gained command of the lake as early as November, 1812. The command
was, however, precarious, since it might be disturbed by the arrival or
construction of new warships. One such was building at York, now known as
Toronto, the capital of Upper Canada, when, on April 27, 1813, the
American squadron under Commodore<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span> Chauncey attacked the town and
succeeded in landing a detachment of troops under General Dearborn. The
British general, Sheaffe, withdrew his regular forces from the town
without awaiting an assault, but not before he had destroyed the ship of
which the enemy were in quest. The Americans captured some naval stores,
but did not attempt to hold the town; they set an evil precedent, however,
by burning the parliament house and other public buildings before
evacuating the place. On May 27 Chauncey co-operated again with Dearborn
in an attack on Fort George, the capture of which threw the whole line of
the Niagara into American hands. On the same day Prevost, whose naval
strength had been reinforced, availing himself of Chauncey's absence, made
an attack on Sackett's Harbour. The attack, which was renewed on the 29th,
was miserably conducted, and ended in failure, though the Americans were
compelled to burn the naval stores captured at York. The reinforcements
had, however, transferred to the British the command of the lake, which
was not challenged again till the end of July. Meanwhile their land forces
were not idle. On June 6 the Americans were surprised by Colonel Vincent
at Burlington Heights and over 100 prisoners, including two
brigadier-generals, were taken. This defeat, combined with the approach of
the British naval squadron under Sir James Yeo, induced Dearborn to
abandon his other posts on the Canadian side of the Niagara and to
concentrate at Fort George, but on the 24th another surprise ended in the
surrender of a detachment of more than 500 Americans to a force of fifty
British troops and 240 Indians. By the end of July Chauncey's squadron was
once more strong enough to put to sea. It raided York on the 31st, but did
not venture to join battle with Yeo; though a skirmish on August 10
enabled Yeo to capture two schooners.</p>

<p>Meanwhile on the frontier of Lower Canada the British were everywhere
successful. On June 3 two American sloops attacked the British garrison of
Isle-aux-noix at the north end of Lake Champlain. Both ships were
compelled to surrender. On August 1 a British force raided Plattsburg and
destroyed the barracks and military stores. A combined movement on
Montreal was now made by the forces of the United States; it was mainly
owing to the loyalty of the French Canadians that they were repulsed.
General Hampton advancing from the south<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span> with a force 7,000 strong was
defeated at the river Chateauguay on October 26, by 900 men belonging to
the Canadian militia, commanded by Colonel McDonnell and Colonel de
Salaberry. The defeated general withdrew his troops into winter quarters
at Plattsburg. Not long after, on December 7, the American general
Wilkinson who had sailed down the St. Lawrence to Prescott and was
marching towards Cornwall, was defeated with heavy loss by Colonel
Morrison at Chrystler's Farm, and made no further attempt on Canada. In
the same month General McClure, who commanded at Fort George, retired to
the eastern bank of the Niagara before Colonel Murray's advance. His
retreat was disgraced by the burning of the town of Newark, where women
and children were turned homeless into the cold of a Canadian winter. At
the same time the American forces were withdrawn from south-western Canada
but still retained Amherstburg at the head of Lake Erie, the sole conquest
of the campaign.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>NAVAL WARFARE.</i></div>

<p>The naval warfare of 1813 was less rich in individual encounters than that
of 1812. The British captains were better acquainted with the strength of
the American ships and did not rashly engage vessels stronger than their
own. There was also a marked improvement in British gunnery, and an
increase in the strength of the British naval force in American waters. At
first the blockade of the American coast had not been strictly maintained
further south than New York, but as reinforcements arrived it was made
more complete, and after June of this year it was only occasionally that
any warship or privateer contrived to elude the blockading vessels.
Meanwhile the British constantly raided and harassed the American coast,
and had no difficulty in availing themselves of the Chesapeake and
Delaware estuaries as naval bases. A new feature of this year's warfare
was the appearance of American cruisers, especially privateers, in British
waters, and even in the St. George's Channel. To such ships the French
ports were a very serviceable naval base. The Americans would appear to
have captured more of British commerce than the British captured of
theirs, but this was no compensation for the almost complete cessation of
their foreign trade. Of single ship actions the destruction of the British
<i>Peacock</i> by the American <i>Hornet</i>, commanded by Captain Lawrence, on
February 24, the capture of the American <i>Argus</i> by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span> the British <i>Pelican</i>
not far from the Welsh coast on August 14, and the famous duel between the
<i>Chesapeake</i> and the <i>Shannon</i> on June 1 were the most important.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_103" id="TOPIC_103"></a>The British frigate <i>Shannon</i> (38) was commanded by Captain Broke, who was
famous not merely for the attention he paid to gun practice, but for the
care he had bestowed on the laying of his ship's ordnance. Ever since the
beginning of April the frigates <i>Shannon</i> and <i>Tenedos</i> (38) had been
lying off Boston, where they hoped to intercept any American frigate that
dared to leave the harbour. Two succeeded in eluding them. The
<i>Chesapeake</i> frigate (36) commanded by Lawrence, lay in the harbour; and
Broke, having detached the <i>Tenedos</i> in order to tempt her out, sent a
challenge to Lawrence on the morning of June 1, but before it could be
delivered the <i>Chesapeake</i> had sailed. She steered for the <i>Shannon</i>, who
waited for her. The fight began at 5.50 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> about six leagues out from
Boston; it was brief and bloody. After ten minutes' firing the
<i>Chesapeake</i> fell on board the <i>Shannon</i>, and was immediately boarded. In
four minutes more every man on board had surrendered. In this short fight
the <i>Shannon</i> had lost out of a crew of 352 twenty-four killed and
fifty-nine wounded, two of the latter mortally, while the <i>Chesapeake</i>,
according to American official figures, had lost out of 386 forty-seven
killed and ninety-nine wounded (fourteen of the latter mortally). No fewer
than thirty-two British deserters were found on board the <i>Chesapeake</i>.
The victory made the best possible impression. The two ships had been of
approximately equal strength, the American having a slight superiority of
force, and the <i>Chesapeake</i> had been captured in the way in which most
turns on individual courage, by boarding. Both captains had distinguished
themselves in the fight, and both were severely wounded, Lawrence, as the
event proved, fatally.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CAMPAIGN IN FRANCE.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_104" id="TOPIC_104"></a>The abandonment of Germany by the French at the close of 1813 left the
outlying provinces and allies of France exposed to invasion. The Austrian
general, Nugent, aided by British naval and military forces, captured
Trieste on October 31. Dalmatia had been invaded by the Montenegrins as
early as September, 1813, and was afterwards attacked by Austrians and
British marines, but the town of Cattaro held out till it was taken by the
British in January, 1814. On<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span> the 14th of the same month Denmark was
compelled by the treaty of Kiel to cede Norway to Sweden in exchange for
Swedish Pomerania and R&uuml;gen, Sweden undertaking to assist Denmark in
procuring a fuller equivalent for Norway at the conclusion of a general
peace. A treaty signed between Denmark and Great Britain at the same time
and place provided for the restitution to Denmark of all British
conquests, with the exception of Heligoland, while Denmark undertook to do
all in her power for the abolition of the slave trade. The people of
Norway and their governor, Prince Christian of Denmark, refused to submit
to the transference of their allegiance, and on February 19 the
independence of Norway was proclaimed. At first the Swedish government
attempted to obtain the submission of Norway by negotiation only, but so
important a diversion of her interest and energies was sufficient to
prevent Sweden from joining in the new campaign against France. In Italy
on January 11 Napoleon's brother-in-law, Murat, whom he had made King of
Naples in 1808, formed an alliance with Austria. The treaty was never
confirmed by Great Britain, but the British government subsequently
consented to support Murat, if he should loyally exert himself in Italy
against Napoleon's forces. Although Murat did actually engage in
hostilities against the French, the British were far from satisfied with
his operations and considered that his remissness left them a free hand.
Accordingly on March 9 a British fleet entered the port of Leghorn and
landed 8,000 men, of whom Lord William Bentinck took command. From Leghorn
he marched upon Genoa which surrendered to him on April 18.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the main forces of the allies were concentrated for a campaign
against Napoleon in Champagne. Of the three armies which had combined at
Leipzig the Austro-Russian army under Schwarzenberg made its way through
Switzerland, Alsace, and Franche-Comt&eacute;, while Bl&uuml;cher's army of Prussians
and Russians passed through the region which afterwards became the Rhine
province and Lorraine. The two armies united in the neighbourhood of
Brienne in Champagne. Bernadotte's army did not as a whole take part in
the campaign; but a portion of it, consisting of Russians under
Wittgenstein and Prussians under B&uuml;low, was engaged in the conquest of
Belgium and was able to invade France itself later in the year.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
Schwarzenberg's army was accompanied by the Emperors of Russia and
Austria, the King of Prussia, and the leading European diplomatists,
including Castlereagh. From the outset there was a marked difference
between the Austrian and Russian policies. Metternich was content with
reducing France to the natural frontiers already offered to her, and aimed
merely at compelling Napoleon to recognise the <i>fait accompli</i> in Germany,
and to evacuate Italy and Spain. He was therefore in favour of slow
advances and of giving Napoleon every opportunity for coming to terms. The
tsar, on the other hand, wished to reduce France to her ancient limits,
and was anxious to enter Paris as a conqueror. He also excited Austrian
jealousy by his scheme of annexing what had been Prussian Poland, and
compensating Prussia with Saxony. Castlereagh and the Prussian minister,
Hardenberg, supported the tsar's policy towards France, but without
sharing his ardour.</p>

<p>On the first arrival of the allies in Champagne the tsar had only induced
Metternich to advance by threatening to prosecute the war alone. After
they had gained what appeared to be a decisive victory over Napoleon at La
Rothi&egrave;re on February 1, negotiations were commenced at Ch&acirc;tillon. Napoleon
insisted on continuing the war during the negotiations and interposed
every possible delay. The allies first demanded that France should recede
within the limits of 1791 and offered a partial restoration of French
colonies, but refused to specify the colonies which they were willing to
relinquish until France should accept the first condition. To this the
French demurred, and on the 9th the tsar impetuously withdrew his
minister. From the 10th to the 14th Napoleon inflicted a series of
crushing blows upon Bl&uuml;cher's army. Negotiations were now resumed; they
lasted till the middle of March, but as Napoleon would not surrender his
claim to Belgium and the Rhine provinces they were fruitless,
notwithstanding the pacific efforts of Caulaincourt, the French
negotiator. On the 21st Napoleon tried in vain to detach Austria from the
allies by a private letter to the Emperor Francis, and on March 1 a
permanent basis was given to the alliance by the treaty of Chaumont
(definitely signed on the 9th), by which the four allied powers bound
themselves to conclude no separate peace, and not to lay down their arms
till the object of the war should have been obtained by the restriction<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
of France to her ancient frontiers. Each power was to maintain 150,000 men
regularly in the field, and Great Britain was to pay the three other
powers a subsidy of &pound;5,000,000 for the current year and a like sum for
every subsequent year of warfare. The signatory powers were to maintain
their present concert and armaments for twenty years if necessary.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>NAPOLEON'S FIRST ABDICATION.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_105" id="TOPIC_105"></a>After this treaty on March 4 Bl&uuml;cher united with Wittgenstein and B&uuml;low
near Soissons. On the 20th Napoleon was repulsed by Schwarzenberg's army
at Arcis-sur-Aube, after which he attempted to cut off its communications
by a movement to its rear. In consequence of this movement the allied
armies advanced on Paris, while the Austrian emperor fled to Dijon taking
Castlereagh and Metternich with him.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> This left the war to be concluded
under the influence of the most vigorous of the allied sovereigns, the
Tsar of Russia. Paris capitulated on the 30th and on the next day was
occupied by the allies. The tsar now issued "on behalf of all the allied
powers" a proclamation in which he declared that they would not treat with
Napoleon or his family, but were willing to respect the integrity of
France, and to guarantee the constitution that the French people should
adopt. This prepared the way for a reaction against Napoleon in France. A
provisional government was formed on April 1; on the 3rd the French senate
proclaimed the deposition of Napoleon, and on the 6th it published a
constitution, and recalled the Bourbons in the person of Louis XVIII., the
younger brother of Louis XVI. On the same day Napoleon signed an
unconditional abdication at Fontainebleau. On the 11th a treaty was signed
between Napoleon and the sovereigns of Austria, Prussia, and Russia, by
which he renounced all claim to the crowns of France and Italy, and was
assigned the Isle of Elba as an independent principality and a place of
residence, together with a liberal revenue charged on the French treasury,
which, however, was never paid. The duchy of Parma was secured to the
Empress Maria Louisa and was to descend to her son. The treaty was
afterwards confirmed by Great Britain, with the exception of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span> clauses
providing revenues for the fallen emperor and his family. The promise of
Elba had been made by the tsar in the absence of Castlereagh and
Metternich. It was vigorously opposed by Castlereagh's half-brother, Sir
Charles Stewart, but the tsar considered his honour bound to it, and
Napoleon sailed from Fr&eacute;jus for Elba on the 28th.</p>

<p>In America the war was conducted with more vigour in 1814 than in previous
years, but with equally small effect on either side. In March the American
general, Wilkinson, advancing from Lake Champlain, was repulsed by a small
British garrison at La Colle Mill. In July an American army under Brown
invaded Upper Canada across the river Niagara. It was attacked by General
Riall, near Chippewa, on the 5th, but it repelled the attack and occupied
that place. Brown was, however, checked by British regulars and Canadian
militia under Sir Gordon Drummond at Lundy's Lane, near Niagara Falls, on
the 25th. Both sides claim the victory, but on the reinforcement of the
British troops Brown abandoned the invasion. After the close of the
Peninsular war some of the best regiments of the Peninsular army,
numbering about 14,000 men, were sent to America. But they were not
commanded by any of the generals who had made their names illustrious in
that war, and did not effect so much as had been expected. On August 19
and 20 General Ross landed with 5,000 men at the mouth of the Patuxent in
Chesapeake Bay. On the 24th he defeated a large body of militia under
General Winder at Bladensburg, and occupied Washington, where he burned
all the public buildings. However deplorable such an act may seem, it is
well to note that it was a fair and even merciful reprisal after the
action of the Americans at York and Newark. Ross did not attempt to retain
the city, but evacuated it on the next day and re-embarked on the 30th. On
September 12 he landed near Baltimore, but was immediately killed in an
attack on the town. The attack had to be abandoned because it proved
impossible to obtain adequate support from the fleet, and the troops
returned to the ships on the 15th.</p>

<p>On September 1 Prevost invaded New York State by Lake Champlain. He
advanced against Plattsburg, which he bombarded on the 11th, but his
flotilla was defeated by an American flotilla during the bombardment, and
he felt him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>self compelled to retreat into Canada. At the end of the year
Sir Edward Pakenham took command of a force operating against New Orleans,
but on January 8, 1815, he was defeated and killed by the American forces
under the future president, Andrew Jackson. No expedition was ever worse
planned than this; the veterans of the Peninsula were mowed down by a
withering fire, and, losing confidence in their leaders, forfeited their
reputation for invincible courage in attack. The fighting, however, was
desperate while it lasted, and was compared by one engaged in it with the
storm of Badajoz, and the deadly charges at Waterloo. It was but a small
compensation for these failures that the British were able to annex a
strip of territory belonging to the State of Maine. On the sea no general
engagement took place, nor was there any naval duel so famous as that
between the <i>Shannon</i> and the <i>Chesapeake</i> in the previous year. The
Americans lost two of their best frigates, but, with crews largely
composed of British sailors, captured several British ships of war.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE TREATY OF GHENT.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_106" id="TOPIC_106"></a>As early as January, 1814, advances had been made towards negotiations for
peace, but they were not actually begun till August 6. In the course of a
few days a serious difficulty arose, as the British commissioners demanded
the delimitation of an Indian territory which should be exempt from
territorial acquisitions on the part of either power, and also claimed the
military occupation of the lakes for their own government. The Americans
thereupon suspended the negotiations, and Castlereagh expressed grave
discontent with the conduct of the British negotiators in pressing these
points. Late in the year negotiations were resumed, when the British
abandoned these claims. The far more comprehensive questions about the
rights of neutrals, which had occasioned the war, had ceased to be of
practical importance now that peace was restored in Europe. They were
therefore, by tacit consent, suffered to drop, and a treaty signed at
Ghent on December 24, 1814, ended a war of which the Canadians alone had
reason to be proud.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_107" id="TOPIC_107"></a>The most dramatic incident in the domestic annals of England in this year
was the visit of the allied sovereigns to this country, after their
triumphal entry into Paris, and the signature of a convention, to be
described hereafter, for the resettlement of Europe. Louis XVIII. left his
retreat at Hartwell on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span> April 20, and reached his capital on May 3 to find
it occupied by foreign armies, and to discover that his French escort,
composed of Napoleon's old guard, was of doubtful loyalty. On July 8 the
Tsar of Russia and the King of Prussia, having accepted an invitation from
the prince regent, which the Emperor of Austria declined, landed at Dover,
and were afterwards received with the utmost enthusiasm in London. Their
appearance betokened the supposed termination of the greatest, and almost
the longest, war recorded in European history, but it was also accepted as
a tribute of gratitude for the unique services rendered by Great Britain,
the only European power which had never bowed the knee to the French
Republic or the French Empire. They attended Ascot races, were feasted at
the Guildhall, witnessed a naval review at Portsmouth, and were decorated
with honorary degrees at Oxford, where Bl&uuml;cher was the hero of the day
with the younger members of the university. There were men of calmer minds
and maturer age, who must have remembered the time, but seven years
before, when Alexander swore eternal friendship with Napoleon, on the
basis of enmity to Great Britain, and Frederick William of Prussia shrunk
from no depths of dishonour, first to aggrandise his kingdom and then to
save the remnants of it from destruction. Others foresaw that a
restoration of the Bourbons portended reaction, in its worst sense,
throughout all the continent of Europe. But such memories and forebodings
were hushed in the sincere and general rejoicing over the return of peace,
marred by no suspicion of the new trials and privations which peace itself
was destined to bring with it for the working classes of Great Britain.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<h3>VIENNA AND WATERLOO.</h3>


<p><a name="TOPIC_108" id="TOPIC_108"></a>After the restoration of Louis XVIII. as a constitutional king, the treaty
of Paris between France and the allied powers was signed on May 30, 1814.
The treaty amounted to a settlement in outline of those territorial
questions in Europe in which France was concerned, and aimed mainly at the
construction of a strong barrier to resist further encroachments by France
on her neighbours. The French boundaries were to coincide generally with
the limits of French territory on January 1, 1792, but with certain
additions. The principle adopted was that France should retain certain
detached pieces of foreign states within her own frontier (such as
M&uuml;hlhausen, Montb&eacute;liard, and the Venaissin), while the line of frontier
was extended so as to include certain detached fragments belonging to
France before 1792, such as Landau, Mariembourg, and Philippeville, as
well as Western Savoy with Chamb&eacute;ry for its capital. She was moreover
allowed to regain all her colonies except the Mauritius, St. Lucia, and
Tobago. The Spanish portion of San Domingo was restored to the Spanish
government. Holland was placed under the sovereignty of the house of
Orange, and was to receive an increase of territory; so much of Italy as
was not to be ceded to Austria was to consist of independent sovereign
states; and Germany was to be formed into a confederation. Finally an
European congress was to meet at Vienna in two months' time "to regulate
the arrangements necessary for completing the dispositions of the treaty".
At the same time secret articles provided that the disposition of
territories was to be controlled at Vienna by Austria, Great Britain,
Prussia, and Russia; that Austria, was to receive Venice and Lombardy as
far as the Ticino; and that the former territories of Genoa were to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span> be
annexed to Sardinia, and the late Austrian Netherlands to Holland.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_109" id="TOPIC_109"></a>In the midst of the general restoration of legitimate princes difficulties
were occasioned by the exceptional cases in which territories were
reserved for the new dynasties that had arisen during the Napoleonic wars.
France, Spain, and Sicily objected to the retention of the kingdom of
Naples by Murat, Spain resented the cession of Parma to the Bonapartes,
and Norway was in revolt against the attempt to subjugate it to the king
of Sweden and his heir Marshal Bernadotte. The Norwegian government under
Prince Christian vainly endeavoured to secure the British recognition of
the independence of Norway. The British government, on the contrary, held
itself bound to support the claims of Sweden, and on April 29 notified a
blockade of the Norwegian ports, which was promptly carried into effect.
Meanwhile a new constitution was promulgated in Norway, and Prince
Christian was proclaimed king. While the British maintained the blockade
Sweden attempted to gain its ends by negotiation. <a name="TOPIC_110" id="TOPIC_110"></a>At last, on July 30, the
Swedes invaded Norway. After some Swedish successes a convention was
signed at Moss on August 14, which recognised the new Norwegian
constitution, but provided for a personal union of the crowns of Sweden
and Norway. This constitution was accepted by Charles XIII. of Sweden in
the following November, and Norway retained almost complete independence,
though united to Sweden.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE SLAVE TRADE.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_111" id="TOPIC_111"></a>Among the last acts of Napoleon's government had been the release and
restoration of Ferdinand VII. of Spain and of Pope Pius VII. Ferdinand,
supported by the vast mass of Spanish opinion, declared against the rather
unpractical constitution established in his absence, and entered Madrid as
an absolute king on May 14. One of his first acts was the revival of the
inquisition. There was some apprehension among British representatives
lest the two restored Bourbon monarchies should renew the family compact,
and also lest they should attempt to assert the Bourbon claims to Naples
and Parma. Sir Henry Wellesley, afterwards Lord Cowley, was, however,
successful in negotiating a treaty of alliance between Great Britain and
Spain, which made provision against any renewal of the family compact,
restored the commercial relations of the two countries to the footing on
which they had been before 1796, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span> promised the future consideration of
means to be adopted for the suppression of the slave trade. Spain was in
fact too dependent on British credit to be able to adopt a line of her own
in politics. But the hold which Great Britain had thus gained over Spain
was somewhat weakened by the British attitude towards the slave trade.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_112" id="TOPIC_112"></a>It is remarkable how large a space the abolition of the slave trade
occupied in the foreign policy of Great Britain, when the liberties of
Europe were at stake. During the months preceding the meeting of the
congress of Vienna, which had been postponed till September by the tsar,
British diplomacy had been engaged in a strenuous effort to obtain the
co-operation of such European powers as possessed American colonies in
securing this philanthropic object. Sweden had already consented to it,
and now Holland also gave her consent. Portugal agreed to relinquish the
trade north of the equator, on condition that the other powers consented
to impose a similar restriction on themselves. Strong pressure was brought
to bear upon France to consent to the immediate abolition of the trade,
and Wellington, who had been created a duke in May and who arrived at
Paris in August in the capacity of British ambassador, was authorised by
Liverpool to offer the cession of Trinidad or the payment of two or three
million pounds to obtain this end. By the treaty of Paris only French
subjects were allowed to trade in slaves with the French colonies, and
French subjects were excluded from trading elsewhere; and the whole trade
was to cease within French dominions after five years. Talleyrand,
negotiating with Wellington, refused to consent to a general abolition,
but, on being pressed to surrender the slave trade north of the equator,
consented to abandon it to the north of Cape Formoso. In the following
year Napoleon on his return from Elba ordered its immediate suppression,
and this was not the least significant act of the Hundred Days. With Spain
our diplomatists were less successful. The British government refused to
renew its subsidy to Spain for the last half of 1814 except on condition
that Spain relinquished the slave trade north of the equator at once, and
consented to relinquish that south of the equator in five years' time;
while it would not issue a loan except on condition that Spain abolished
the whole trade immediately. Even these terms did not prevail with Spain,
and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span> most that she would grant at the congress was to relinquish the
trade at the conclusion of eight years.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_113" id="TOPIC_113"></a>Meanwhile Talleyrand was endeavouring to induce Great Britain to combine
with France in a joint mediation between Austria and Russia at the
congress, in the event of Russia demanding the duchy of Warsaw.
Wellington, while expressing himself in favour of an understanding,
refused to accept anything which might seem equivalent to a declaration in
favour of mediation by the two powers in every case. At the congress
itself Great Britain was first represented by Castlereagh, who was
succeeded in February, 1815, by Wellington. The two principal difficulties
were the questions of Poland and Saxony. The tsar desired to erect the
duchy of Warsaw, Prussia's share in the two partitions of Poland in 1793
and 1795, into a constitutional monarchy attached to the Russian crown,
while Prussia, though not unwilling to resign her claims to Polish
dominion, wished to increase her territory by the incorporation of Saxony
in her monarchy. Austria was naturally averse from any increase of
strength in the states on her northern borders, and she was also opposed
to the establishment of a constitutional monarchy in Poland which might
serve as a centre for political discontent in her own dominions. Even
France urged this objection to a constitutional Poland. Great Britain
alone was willing to see an independent Poland, but preferred to join
France, Prussia, and Austria in demanding its repartition between the two
latter powers rather than its annexation to Russia. All through October
Austria, Great Britain, and Prussia endeavoured to induce the tsar to
withdraw his demand. Early in November he won over the King of Prussia to
whom he promised the kingdom of Saxony, proposing to indemnify the Saxon
king with a new state on that lower Rhine which France was not allowed to
have, but which no other power desired.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE RETURN OF NAPOLEON.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_114" id="TOPIC_114"></a>It was no longer possible to resist Russia's claims on Poland, but Austria
was determined not to allow Prussia to receive the proffered compensation.
On December 10 Metternich notified the Prussian minister, Hardenberg, that
he would not allow Prussia to annex more than a fifth part of Saxony.
Great Britain, France, Bavaria, and the minor German states joined Austria
in this action, and thus the attempt to effect a settle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>ment of Europe by
a concert of the four allied powers broke down. On January 3, 1815, a
secret treaty was concluded between Austria, France, and Great Britain in
defence of what their diplomatists called "the principles of the peace of
Paris". Each of these powers was to be prepared, if necessary, to place an
army of 50,000 men in the field. Bavaria joined them in their preparations
for war, and many of the troops which occupied Paris in 1815 would have
been disbanded or dispersed, but for the prospect of a rupture between the
allies themselves. But a compromise was soon arranged, and on February 8
it was agreed that Cracow, the Polish fortress which threatened Austria
most, should be an independent republic, and that Prussia should retain
enough of Western Poland to round off her dominions, while the remainder
of the duchy of Warsaw became a constitutional kingdom under the tsar.
Prussia was to be allowed to annex part of Saxony, and was to receive a
further compensation on the left bank of the Rhine and in Westphalia. The
most thorny questions were now settled, and Castlereagh had left Vienna
when the congress was electrified by the news that Napoleon had reappeared
in France.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_115" id="TOPIC_115"></a>The episode of "the Hundred Days" interrupted, but did not break up, the
councils of the congress at Vienna. It cannot be said that Napoleon's
escape from Elba took the negotiators altogether by surprise. They were
already aware of his correspondence with the neighbouring shores of Italy,
and his removal to St Helena or some other distant island had been
proposed by the French government, though never discussed at the congress.
Sir Neil Campbell, the British commissioner at Elba, had gone so far as to
warn his government of Napoleon's suspected "plan," and to indicate,
though erroneously, the place of his probable descent upon the Italian
coast. Owing to an almost incredible want of precaution, he embarked on
February 26 with the least possible disguise, and accompanied by 400 of
his guards, on board his brig the <i>Inconstant</i>, eluded the observation of
two French ships, and landed near Cannes on March 1. Thence he hastened
across the mountains to Grenoble, passing unmolested, and sometimes
welcomed, through districts where his life had been threatened but a few
months before. The commandant of Grenoble was prepared to resist his
further progress, but a heart-stirring appeal from Napoleon induced a
regi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>ment detached to oppose him to join his standard, and the rest of the
garrison was brought over by Colonel Labedoy&egrave;re, one of the officers who
had conspired to bring him back. Thence he proceeded to Lyons, issuing
decrees, scattering proclamations, and gathering followers at every stage.
He was lavish of promises, not perhaps wholly insincere, that he would
adopt constitutional government&mdash;already established by the charter of
Louis XVIII.&mdash;and cease to wage aggressive wars. He relied unduly on the
discontent provoked by the blind partisans of the Bourbons, who, it was
said, had learned nothing and forgotten nothing. This was true, if the
spirit of the restoration were to be measured by the parade of expiatory
masses for the execution of royalists under the revolution, the
ostentatious patronage of priests, the preference of returned <i>&eacute;migr&eacute;s</i> to
well-tried servants of the republic and the empire, or the anticipated
expulsion of landowners in possession of "national domains" for the
purpose of dividing them among their old proprietors. All this naturally
exasperated those who had imbibed the principles of the revolution, but it
was more than compensated in the eyes of millions of Frenchmen by the
cessation of conscription and the infinite blessings of peace.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>"THE HUNDRED DAYS."</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_116" id="TOPIC_116"></a>The king was amongst the least infatuated of the royalists. On hearing of
Napoleon's proclamation, he had the sense to appreciate the danger of such
a bid for sovereignty and the magic of such a name, while his courtiers
regarded Napoleon's enterprise as the last effort of a madman. He
addressed the chamber of deputies in confident and dignified language; the
Duke of Angoul&ecirc;me was employed to rouse the royalist party at Bordeaux;
the Duke of Bourbon was sent into Brittany, the Count of Artois, with the
Duke of Orl&eacute;ans and Marshal Macdonald, visited Lyons, upon the attitude of
which everything, for the moment, seemed to depend. Most of the marshals
remained faithful to the restored monarchy, and Ney was selected to bar
the progress of Napoleon in Burgundy, and has been credited with a vow
that he would bring him back in an iron cage. But it was all in vain. The
Count of Artois was loyally received by the officials and upper classes at
Lyons, but he soon found that Napoleon possessed the hearts of the
soldiers and the mass of the people. Ney yielded to urgent appeals from
his old chief, signed and read to his troops a pro<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>clamation drawn up by
Napoleon himself, and was followed in his treason by his whole army. As
Napoleon approached Paris, all armed opposition to him melted away. On
March 19, Louis XVIII., seeing that his cause was hopeless, proclaimed a
dissolution of the chambers, and retired once more into exile, fixing his
residence at Ghent.</p>

<p>Napoleon re-entered the Tuileries on the 20th, after a journey which he
afterwards described as the happiest in his life. But his penetrating mind
was not deceived by the manifestations of popular joy. He well knew that
he was distrusted by the middle classes, as well as by the aristocracy,
and threw himself more and more on the sympathy of the old revolutionists.
When he came to fill up the higher offices, he met with a strange
reluctance to accept them, and was driven to enlist the services of two
regicides, the virtuous republican, Carnot, and the double-dyed traitor
Fouch&eacute;. Feeling the necessity of resting his power on a democratic basis,
he promulgated a constitution modelled on the charter of Louis XVIII., and
known as the <i>Acte Additionnel</i>, which, however, satisfied no one. The
royalists objected to its anti-feudal spirit, the revolutionists and
moderates to its express recognition of an hereditary peerage, and its
tacit recognition of a dictatorial power. It was by no means with a light
heart that Napoleon took leave of Paris on June 7, having appointed a
provisional government, to place himself at the head of his army.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_117" id="TOPIC_117"></a>Attempts had been made in the southern provinces and La Vend&eacute;e to organise
armed rebellion against the emperor, and met for a time with considerable
success. But they were soon quelled by the overwhelming imperialism not
only of the regular army, but of vast numbers of disbanded soldiers and
half-pay officers, dispersed throughout France, and disgusted with their
treatment under the restored monarchy. Even among the <i>bourgeoisie</i>
Napoleon had an advantage which he never possessed before. Disguise it as
he might, all his former wars had been essentially wars of conquest, and,
however patiently they might endure it, the peasantry of France, in
thousands upon thousands of humble cottages, groaned under the exaction of
crushing taxes&mdash;worst of all, the blood-tax of conscription&mdash;in order to
enable one man, in the name of France, to usurp the empire of the world.
Now, however, as in the early days of the revolu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>tion, France was put on
its defence, and called upon to repel an invasion of its frontiers. For
the news of Napoleon's escape, announced by Talleyrand on March 11,
instantly stilled the quarrels and rebuked the jealousies which had so
nearly proved fatal to any settlement at Vienna. For the moment, the
designs of Russia in Poland, the selfish demands of Prussia, and the
half-formed coalition between Great Britain, France, and Austria, were
thrust into the background. Austria thought it necessary to repudiate
decisively the audaciously false assertion of Napoleon that he was
returning with the concurrence of his father-in-law, and would shortly be
supported by Austrian troops. Metternich, therefore, assumed the lead in
drawing up a solemn manifesto, dated March 13, in which Napoleon was
virtually declared an outlaw "abandoned to public justice," and the powers
which had signed the treaty of Paris in the preceding May bound
themselves, in the face of Europe, to carry out all its provisions and
defend the king of France, if need be, against his own rebellious
subjects.</p>

<p>By a further convention made at the end of March, they engaged to provide
forces exceeding 700,000 men in the aggregate, to be concentrated on the
Upper Rhine, the Lower Rhine, and the Low Countries, with an immense
reserve of Russians to be rapidly moved across Germany from Poland.
Wellington having succeeded Castlereagh at Vienna, was appointed to
command the British, Hanoverian, and Belgian contingents on the north-east
frontier of France; Bl&uuml;cher's headquarters were to be on the Lower Rhine,
within easy reach of that frontier; for, whichever side might take the
offensive, it was there that the first shock of war might be expected. The
recent conclusion of peace with America at Ghent on December 24, 1814,
left England free to use her whole military power. Enormous sums were
voted by Parliament, with a rare approach to unanimity, for the equipment
of a British army, and a sum of &pound;5,000,000 for subsidies to the allied
powers. A small section of the opposition led by Whitbread opposed the
renewal of war. On April 7 he moved an amendment to the address in reply
to the prince regent's message announcing that measures for the security
of Europe were being concerted with the allies, but he was only supported
by 32 votes against 220. On April 28 his motion for an address<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span> to the
prince regent, deprecating war with Napoleon, was defeated by 273 votes
against 72. This was Whitbread's last prominent appearance in parliament.
On July 6, during a fit of insanity, he died by his own hand. The
subsidies to the allies were opposed by Bankes, but were carried on May 26
by 160 votes against 17. There can be no doubt that the majorities in the
house of commons correctly expressed the national sentiment. Nobody wished
to dictate to France the form of government which she was to adopt, but it
was generally felt that Napoleon's character rendered peace with him
impossible.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE CAMPAIGN OF 1815.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_118" id="TOPIC_118"></a>In the end, about 80,000 men were assembled in Belgium under Wellington's
orders, but of these not half were British soldiers, including untrained
drafts from the militia, who replaced veteran Peninsular regiments still
detained in Canada and the United States. Yet Napoleon admitted the
British contingent to be equal, man for man, to his own troops, while he
estimated these to be worth twice their own number of Dutchmen, Prussians,
or other Germans. The first blow in the war was struck by Murat. Already
in February, dissatisfied with his ambiguous position, he had levied
troops and summoned Louis XVIII. to declare whether he was at war with
him. As soon as he heard of Napoleon's return, he invaded the Papal
States, and summoned the Italians to rise in the cause of Italian unity
and independence. Though disowned by Napoleon, he persevered in this plan,
but he was attacked and twice defeated by an Austrian army. On May 22 the
British and Austrians took the city of Naples, and Murat fled to France.
In October he made an attempt to recover his kingdom, but was captured and
shot. It is noteworthy that, on hearing of his fate at St. Helena,
Napoleon showed but little sympathy with his brother-in-law.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_119" id="TOPIC_119"></a>On the morning of June 12, Napoleon left Paris, saying as he entered his
carriage that he went to match himself with Wellington. All his troops
were already marshalled on the Belgian frontier, and numbered 124,588 men,
with 344 guns. The Imperial Guard alone was 20,954 strong, and the whole
army was largely composed of seasoned veterans. The Prussian army
consisted of 116,897 men, with 312 guns under Marshal Bl&uuml;cher, whose
headquarters were at Namur. Though the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span> majority of these were veterans,
there was a considerable leaven of inferior troops, hastily raised from
the Westphalian and Rhine militia. Between this town and Quatre Bras lay
the Prussian line of defence, Sombreffe being the centre, with Ligny and
St. Amand in front of it, and rather on the south-west. Wellington's
headquarters were at Brussels, and, having no certain intelligence of
Napoleon's movements, he kept the various divisions of his army within
easy distance of that capital until the very eve of the final conflict. Of
the 93,717 men under his command, 31,253 were British, two-thirds of whom
had never been under fire; 6,387 were of the king's German legion; 15,935
Hanoverians; 29,214 (including 4,300 Nassauers in the service of the
Prince of the Netherlands) Dutch and Belgians; 6,808 Brunswickers; 2,880
Nassauers; the engineers, numbering 1,240, were not classified by
nationality. He fully expected that Napoleon would move upon Brussels
along the route by Mons and Hal, and maintained in later days that such
would have been the best strategical course. Napoleon thought otherwise,
and resolved to strike in between the Prussian and British armies,
crushing the former before the latter could be fully assembled. He very
nearly succeeded, and, if all had gone as he hoped, he could scarcely have
failed to win one of his greatest victories.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>LIGNY AND QUATRE BRAS.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_120" id="TOPIC_120"></a>On the evening of the 15th, Wellington was still at Brussels, with the
great body of his army, and only a weak force of Dutch and Belgians was at
Quatre Bras, some sixteen miles to the south. Bl&uuml;cher, with about
three-fourths of his army, was at Sombreffe, a few miles south-east of
Quatre Bras. Napoleon himself was at or close by Charleroi, ten or twelve
miles south of Quatre Bras; the mass of his army was at Fleurus,
south-west of Sombreffe, with Ligny and St. Amand between it and the
Prussians; and Marshal Ney, with Reille's corps, was at Frasnes, opposite
to and due south of Quatre Bras. On the morning of the 16th, Napoleon
arrived from Charleroi at Fleurus, and carefully inspected his enemy's
position, but delayed his attack upon Ligny and St Amand until half-past
two in the afternoon. The Prussians outnumbered the French, and a
murderous conflict ensued among the streets, gardens, and enclosures of
these little towns, which lasted until eight or nine o'clock. At last
Napoleon ordered his guard to advance, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span> the plateau behind Ligny was
taken, with a loss to the French of 12,000, and to the Prussians of over
20,000. Bl&uuml;cher himself was unhorsed and severely bruised in a furious
charge of cavalry, but the Prussians retired in good order towards Wavre,
north of the battlefield.</p>

<p>Had Ney been in a condition to obey an urgent message from Napoleon, and
to envelop the Prussian right and rear, this defeat would have been
overwhelming in its effect. But while the battle of Ligny was raging,
another battle was going on at Quatre Bras, six miles distant, in which
the French sustained a serious check. Happily for the British, Ney failed
to bring up his divisions for an attack on Quatre Bras until two o'clock
in the afternoon, when the Dutch and Belgians under the Prince of Orange
were still his only opponents. The news for which Wellington had been
waiting did not reach him until just before the memorable ball, given by
the Duchess of Richmond at Brussels on the night of the 15th, which he
nevertheless attended, hurrying off his troops to Quatre Bras. They
arrived just in time to reinforce the Prince of Orange and save the
position; but Ney, too, was receiving fresh reinforcements every hour, the
Duke of Brunswick was killed, and a fearful stress fell on Picton's
division and the Hanoverians, who alone were a match for Ney's splendid
infantry and Kellermann's cuirassiers.</p>

<p>These made a charge like that which had borne down the Austrians at
Marengo, but the British squares were proof against it, and when a
division of guards came up from Nivelles, the French in turn were put on
the defensive and retreated to Frasnes. The loss on the British side was
4,500 men; that on the French somewhat less. It is not difficult to
imagine what the issue of the battle must have been if D'Erlon's corps had
been brought into action. This corps was occupied in marching and
countermarching, under contradictory orders from Napoleon and Ney, between
the British left and the Prussian right during the whole of this eventful
day. Its appearance in the distance just when Napoleon was about to launch
his guard against the Prussians at Ligny, caused him to hesitate long, and
lose the decisive moment for demolishing his enemy. Its failure to appear
at Quatre Bras, and to roll up the wavering Dutch-Belgians, before Picton
took up the fighting, enabled Wellington to hold his ground at first, to
repulse Ney afterwards, and on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span> hearing of Bl&uuml;cher's defeat at Ligny, to
fall back in good order on Waterloo. Even then, something was due to good
fortune. Had Napoleon joined Ney and marched direct on Quatre Bras early
on the 17th, it is difficult to see how his advance to Brussels could have
been arrested. But whether he was exhausted by his incessant labours since
leaving Paris, or whether his marvellous intuition was deserting him,
certain it is that he allowed that critical morning to slip by without an
effort&mdash;and without a reconnaissance. He assumed that Bl&uuml;cher must retire
upon Namur as his base of operations, and that Wellington, retiring
towards Brussels, would be cut off from his allies. He therefore
despatched Marshal Grouchy, with 33,000 men, to follow up the Prussians
eastward by the Namur road. His assumption was unfounded. Bl&uuml;cher, loyal
to his engagements, retired upon Wavre; Wellington, relying upon Bl&uuml;cher's
loyalty, took his stand on the field of Waterloo; and this error on the
part of Napoleon determined the fortunes of the campaign.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>WATERLOO.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_121" id="TOPIC_121"></a>The British army retreated upon Waterloo almost unmolested. Ney was
probably awaiting orders, and Napoleon, believing the Prussians to be at
Namur, probably thought he might safely rest himself and his army before
crushing Wellington at his leisure. When they realised that Wellington was
deliberately moving his army to a position nearer Brussels, they both
followed in pursuit along different roads converging at Quatre Bras, and a
brisk skirmish took place near Genappe between Ney's cavalry and that of
the British rear-guard. Heavy rain came on, and the two armies spent a
miserable night, half a mile from each other, close to Mont St. Jean, and
south of Waterloo. Napoleon rose before daybreak on the 18th, reconnoitred
the British position, and convinced himself that Wellington intended to
give battle. He expressed to his staff his satisfaction and confidence of
victory, when General Foy, who had experience of the Peninsular war,
replied in significant words: "Sire, when the British infantry stand at
bay, they are the very devil himself". Why Napoleon did not begin the
battle at eight o'clock has been the subject of much discussion. It is
said that he waited for Grouchy to join him before the close of the
action. But neither he nor Grouchy, though aware<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span> that at least a large
force of Prussians had gone to Wavre and not to Namur, suspected that
Bl&uuml;cher had promised Wellington to march with his whole army on the
morning of the 18th to support the British at Waterloo. It is more likely
that he waited for his men to assemble and for the ground to dry and
become more practicable for his powerful artillery.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>Exception has been taken to the conduct of Wellington in detaching 17,000
men to guard the approach to Brussels at Hal, and, still more, in not
recalling them, when he must have ascertained that nothing was to be
feared on that side, and when such a reinforcement of his right wing must
have been all-important. But it must be remembered that in this force
there were only 1,500 English troops, and 2,000 Hanoverian militia. The
rest were Dutch and Belgians. At all events, Napoleon left his right flank
undefended, though he was already somewhat anxious about the Prussian
movements, and Wellington fought the battle of Waterloo with a force
numerically inferior to that under Napoleon's command, though it might
have been rendered superior by the accession of the Hal contingent. The
effective part of this force, numbering in all 67,661 men, consisted of
24,000 British soldiers, 6,000 soldiers of the king's German legion, and
about 11,000 Hanoverians. Napoleon's force numbered 72,000 men, and it was
stronger both in cavalry and in guns. It represented the flower of the
French army; there were few, if any, recruits as raw as those who swelled
the ranks of the British regiments; there were thousands upon thousands
who had formed part of that <i>Grande Arm&eacute;e</i> which had overawed the
continent of Europe. It is fair, however, to record that, while the
British rank and file suffered much for want of sufficient food, the
French had fared still worse, and that very many of them could have been
in no fit condition for the struggle impending over them.</p>

<p>Both armies occupied ground extending from west to east, on opposite
ridges, and crossed at right angles by the great highway running north and
south from Charleroi to Brussels. In front of the British right were the
ch&acirc;teau and enclosures of Hougoumont which were occupied by the British;
nearly in front of the centre were the large farm-house and buildings of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
La Haye Sainte. Further to the left were the hamlet of Smohain and the
farms Papelotte and La Haye. Wellington had arranged his brigades so as to
distribute the older troops as much as possible among the less
experienced. Sir Thomas Picton's fifth division formed the left of the
line; to his right was Alten's second division, and beyond him to the
right was the guards division under Cooke. Further to the right and partly
in reserve was Clinton's second division, while Chass&eacute;'s Dutch division on
the extreme right occupied the village of Braine l'Alleud. Somerset's
brigade of heavy cavalry and Kruse's Dutch cavalry were posted behind
Alten's division, and Ponsonby's "union brigade," consisting of the royal
dragoons, Scots greys, and Inniskillings, was stationed in Picton's rear.
The whole line lay on the inner slopes of the ridge with the exception of
Bylandt's Dutch-Belgian brigade which was posted on the outer slope in
front of Picton's division. D'Erlon's corps was opposite the British left,
Reille's opposite the British right. Squadrons of cavalry covered the
outer flank of either of the two French corps. The magnificent squadrons
of French cavalry, 15,000 strong, under Milhaud, Kellermann, and other
famous leaders, were in the second line; the imperial guard, as usual, was
massed in the rear.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>WATERLOO.</i></div>

<p>The battle opened about half-past eleven with a furious attack on
Hougoumont. It was defended with desperate gallantry, mainly by the
British guards, who reopened the old loopholes in the garden-walls, and
closed by sheer muscular force the eastern gate of the yard, which had
been forced open by the French. In the fruitless siege of Hougoumont, as
it may be called, the French left wing thus wasted most of its strength,
and incurred enormous loss. Meanwhile, the French right wing under
D'Erlon, advanced to attack the British left, which had been assailed for
an hour and a half by the fire of a battery with seventy-eight guns. The
Dutch and Belgians, who in their exposed position had suffered severely
from the French artillery fire, soon gave way; but Picton's division,
after a single volley, charged with the bayonet and drove their assailants
reeling backward, though Picton himself fell dead on the field. Without
orders from Wellington, Lord Uxbridge, in command of the British cavalry,
seized the opportunity, and launched the union brigade with other
regiments upon the flying masses.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span> This whirlwind of British horsemen
swept all before it, slaughtering many of the French cavalry in passing,
taking 3,000 prisoners, sabring the gunners of Ney's battery, and spiking
fifteen of the guns. But their ardour carried them too far. By Napoleon's
orders a large force of French cuirassiers and lancers fell upon their
flank before they could take breath again, and their ranks were
frightfully thinned in a disorderly retreat. But their charge had saved
the day.</p>

<p>At one o'clock, while the fate of D'Erlon's onslaught was still undecided,
Napoleon observed Prussian troops on his right. An intercepted despatch
proved these to be B&uuml;low's corps. He instantly sent off a despatch to
Grouchy, whom he supposed to be within reach, ordering him to attack B&uuml;low
in the rear. Then followed the memorable succession of charges by the
whole of the French cavalry upon the squares of the British infantry. Not
one of these squares was broken; a great part of the French cavalry was
mown down by volleys or cut to pieces by the British cavalry in their
precipitate retreat, and the British line remained unmoved, though
grievously weakened, behind its protecting ridge. This was the crisis of
the fight. Much of the British artillery was dismounted, and Wellington
confessed to one of his staff that he longed for the advent of night or
Bl&uuml;cher. Napoleon next felt himself compelled to detach Lobau's corps for
the purpose of meeting the advancing Prussians. Soon afterwards Ney
carried La Haye Sainte by a most determined assault, aided by the failure
of ammunition within its defences, and thus captured the key of the
British position. But Napoleon saw that his one chance of victory lay in a
final <i>coup</i> before the Prussians could wrest it from him. He ordered the
imperial guard to the front, leading it himself across the valley, and
then handing over the command to Ney. The guard was but the remnant of its
original strength, for all its cavalry had been wrecked in wild charges
against the British squares, and several battalions of its infantry were
kept in reserve to hold back the Prussians and protect the baggage train.
Nevertheless, the advance of this superb corps, the heroes of a hundred
fights, who had seldom failed to hurl back the tide of battle at the most
perilous junctures, was among the most impressive spectacles in the annals
of war. They swerved a little to the left, thereby exposing themselves to
the fire of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span> British footguards and of a battery in excellent
condition. The former were lying down for shelter, but when the imperial
guard came within sixty paces of them they started up at the word of
command from Wellington himself. The footguards poured a deadly fire into
the front, and the 52nd regiment into the flank of their columns; as they
wavered under the storm of shot a bayonet charge followed, and the
imperial guard, hitherto almost invincible, was dissolved into a mob of
fugitives scattered over the plain.</p>

<p>It was now past eight o'clock; B&uuml;low's Prussians had long been engaged on
the British left, and Bl&uuml;cher, with indomitable energy, was pressing
forward with all his other divisions. Wellington first sent Vandeleur's
and Vivian's cavalry, still comparatively fresh, to sweep away what
remained of the French reserves, and then ordered a general advance. The
French retreat speedily became a rout, and a rout to which there is no
parallel except that which succeeded the battle of Leipzig. Wellington and
Bl&uuml;cher met at La Belle Alliance on the high road, just south of the
battlefield, and lately the French headquarters. The British troops were
utterly tired out, but the Prussian cavalry never drew rein until they had
driven the last Frenchman over the river Sambre in their relentless
pursuit. The slaughter had been prodigious, though far short of that at
Borodino. The British army lost 13,000 men, the Prussian 7,000, and the
French 37,000<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> (including prisoners), besides the whole of their
artillery, ammunition, baggage-waggons, and military train. But the battle
was one of the most decisive recorded in history, and was the real
beginning of a peace which lasted over the whole of Europe for nearly
forty years. Grouchy heard the cannonade of Waterloo on his march from
Ligny to Wavre, and was strongly urged by G&eacute;rard to hasten across country,
with his whole force, in the direction of the firing. But he pleaded the
letter of Napoleon's instructions, and reached Wavre only to find Bl&uuml;cher
gone. After an encounter with a Prussian corps, which had been left
behind, he received news of Napoleon's defeat, and ultimately escaped into
France.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>NAPOLEON'S SECOND ABDICATION.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_122" id="TOPIC_122"></a>The march of the allies into France after the battle of Waterloo was not
wholly unchecked, but it was far more rapid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span> than in 1814. The French
could not be rallied, and in the first week of July Paris was occupied by
Anglo-Prussian troops. The Austrians and Prussians were moving again upon
the eastern frontiers of France, but were still far behind. The Prussian
general and soldiers were animated by the bitterest spirit of vengeance,
and it needed all the firmness of Wellington to prevent the bridge of Jena
from being blown up, and a ruinous contribution levied on the citizens of
Paris. <a name="TOPIC_123" id="TOPIC_123"></a>Napoleon himself was now at Rochefort, having quitted Paris after a
second abdication on June 22, but four days after the battle. No other
course was open to him. When he started for his last campaign, he was no
longer the champion of an united nation, and consciously staked his all on
a single throw. When he returned from it, discomfited and without an army,
he found the chambers actively hostile to him. Carnot, who had formerly
opposed his assumption of the imperial title, was now the only one of his
ministers to deprecate his abdication, but Napoleon himself saw no hope of
retaining his power, or transmitting it to his son, without a reckless
appeal to revolutionary passions. From this he shrank, and he represented
himself at St. Helena as having sacrificed personal ambition to
patriotism.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_124" id="TOPIC_124"></a>The chamber of deputies appointed an executive commission of five,
including the infamous Fouch&eacute;, and from this body the late emperor
actually received an order to quit Paris. He retired to Malmaison, where
he received a fresh order to set out for Rochefort, which he reached on
July 3. On the next day Paris capitulated to the allies, and the necessity
for his leaving the shores of France became more urgent. Two frigates were
assigned for his escape to America, but a British squadron was lying ready
to intercept them. Some of his bolder companions devised a scheme for
smuggling him on board a swift merchant ship, but it was foiled by the
vigilant watch of the British squadron off the islands of Ol&eacute;ron and R&eacute;.
At last he surrendered himself on board the <i>Bellerophon</i>, relying, as he
said, on the honour of the British nation, and claiming the generous
protection of the prince regent. He was, however, clearly informed that he
would be at the disposal of the government. Under an agreement with the
allied powers, the ministers decided, and were supported by the nation in
deciding, that he could not be detained in England, either<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span> as a guest or
as a prisoner, with any regard to public safety or the verdict of Europe
at Vienna. The proposal of banishing him to St. Helena, suggested in the
previous year, was finally adopted, and he sailed thither in the
<i>Northumberland</i> on August 8, vehemently protesting against the bad faith
of Great Britain. <a name="TOPIC_125" id="TOPIC_125"></a>Louis XVIII. was restored, and the treaty of Vienna,
signed on the eve of the Waterloo campaign, was but slightly modified.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_126" id="TOPIC_126"></a>The action of Murat had solved the difficulties which the congress had to
face in Italy. The kingdom of the Two Sicilies reverted to the Bourbon,
Ferdinand; and the Bourbons also acquired a right of reversion in Parma,
where the protest of Spain against the rule of Maria Louisa could now be
ignored. Genoa was annexed to the kingdom of Sardinia; the pope received
back the states of the Church; the Grand Duke of Tuscany and the Duke of
Modena were restored; while Austria had to be content with Venetia and
Lombardy as far as the Ticino. The organisation of Germany occupied the
congress until June, and was the least durable part of its work. The basis
of it was a confederation of thirty-eight states, represented and in
theory controlled by a diet under the presidency of Austria. This diet
naturally resolved itself into a mere permanent congress of diplomatists
for the purpose of settling the mutual relations of the constituent
states. Each state was ordered to adopt a constitutional form of
government, but, as no provision was made for enforcing this clause, it
remained a dead letter. Prussia regained her provinces on the left bank of
the Rhine, with a population exceeding 1,000,000, and was allotted the
northern part of Saxony, with a population of 800,000, besides retaining
her original share of Poland, with the province of Posen, which had formed
part of the duchy of Warsaw. Most of this duchy was annexed by Russia, but
Cracow was left a republic. Prussia also gained Swedish Pomerania.
Bavaria, Hanover, and Denmark profited more or less by the repartition of
Germany. Denmark, however, finally lost Norway, and Sweden paid the price
of this acquisition by resigning Finland to Russia. The neutrality of
Switzerland was proclaimed and her constitution simplified. The Belgian
Netherlands were united to Holland, the two forming together the kingdom
of the Netherlands, to which Austria ceded all her claims in the Low
Countries.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE SECOND TREATY OF PARIS.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_127" id="TOPIC_127"></a>The treaty of Vienna left the boundaries of France itself as they had been
defined by the first treaty of Paris in 1814. The second treaty of Paris,
however, signed on November 20, 1815, was less favourable to France, which
had already ceded Western Savoy to Sardinia, and was now required to
abandon Landau and other outlying territories beyond the frontier of 1792.
She was also compelled to restore all the works of art accumulated during
the war.</p>

<p>Great Britain had failed to obtain from the congress any binding
regulation on the subject of the slave trade. The most that she could
obtain was a solemn denunciation of that trade issued on February 8, which
declared it to be "repugnant to the principles of civilisation and of
universal morality". The moderation of the British demands, as embodied in
these treaties, excited not only the amazement but the contempt of
Napoleon, who discussed the subject at St. Helena with great freedom. Well
knowing that his paramount object throughout all his wars and negotiations
had been to crush Great Britain, and that Great Britain had been the
mainstay of all the combinations against him, he could find no explanation
of our self-denial except our insular simplicity. Perhaps it might be
attributed with greater reason to politic magnanimity; nor, indeed, could
Great Britain, as a member of the European council, dictate such terms as
Napoleon suggested. Still, the gains of Great Britain were substantial.
She retained Ceylon, the Cape of Good Hope, the Isle of France
(Mauritius), Trinidad, St. Lucia, Tobago, and, above all, Malta. She also
obtained possession of Heligoland and the protectorate of the Ionian
Islands, both of which she has since resigned of her own accord. If she
afterwards lost the commanding position which she had attained among the
allied powers, it was chiefly because the colossal empire which she had
defied was effectually shattered, because neither her armies nor her
subsidies were any longer needed on the continent of Europe, and perhaps
because the energies of her statesmen were no longer braced up by the
stress of a struggle for national life.</p>

<p>Even before the allied armies entered Paris Wellington considered it
necessary to induce Louis XVIII. to make advances to certain politicians
of the revolution so as to inspire national confidence in him, and to
anticipate the risk of a "White<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span> Terror," or a continuance of the war.
Fouch&eacute; was accordingly summoned to power, and he had sufficient influence
to prevent any national opposition to the Bourbon restoration. Napoleon
remained at large for three weeks after his abdication, that is, for eight
days after the allied troops had entered Paris, and the fear of a future
Bonapartist revolution inclined the British government under Liverpool to
entertain favourably the demand of Prussia for the cession of Alsace,
Lorraine, and the northern fortresses. When, however, Napoleon had placed
himself on board the <i>Bellerophon</i>, the situation changed. A contented
France seemed preferable to an impotent France, and Wellington argued that
the Bourbon restoration could not last, if French opinion connected it
with the loss of Alsace and Lorraine. The tsar took this line from the
first, and Wellington won for it the adhesion first of his own government
and then of Austria. Prussia had finally to be contented with a provision
for the cession of the outlying districts, which the treaty of Paris of
1814 had left to France. The second treaty of Paris, which embodied this
stipulation, also provided for an indemnity of &pound;40,000,000 to be paid by
France to the allies, and for the temporary occupation of Northern France
by the allied armies. On the same day Austria, Great Britain, Prussia, and
Russia signed a treaty pledging themselves to act together in case fresh
revolution and usurpation in France should endanger the repose of other
states, and providing for frequent meetings of congresses to preserve the
peace of Europe.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_128" id="TOPIC_128"></a>In addition to the formal treaties of alliance signed at Chaumont, Vienna,
and Paris, an attempt was made by the Tsar Alexander to bind together the
European sovereigns in an union based on the principles of Christian
brotherhood. A form of treaty was accordingly drawn up which gave
expression to these motives, dealt with all Christians as one nation, and
committed their sovereigns to mutual affection and reciprocal service.
This treaty of the holy alliance was signed on September 26, by Austria,
Prussia, and Russia. All European princes except the sultan were invited
to adhere to it, and all except the pope and the sultan ultimately either
accepted it or expressed their sympathy with its principles. But in
England there was hardly a statesman who regarded the treaty seriously,
Wellington avowed his distrust of it, the prince regent declined to join<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
it, and its effective value in promoting the subsequent concert of the
powers was less than nothing. Still, however visionary and extravagantly
worded, it remains as an unique record embodying the deliberate adoption
of the principle of international brotherhood, and the sacrifice of
separate national interests for the sake of European peace.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>NAPOLEON AT ST. HELENA.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_129" id="TOPIC_129"></a>It is remarkable that so little public discussion took place on two
questions which have since been so hotly debated&mdash;the legal <i>status</i> of
Napoleon after he surrendered himself, and the moral right of Great
Britain to banish him to St. Helena. One reason for this apparent
indifference to the fate of one who had overawed all Europe may be found
in the fact that parliament was not sitting when the decision of the
government was taken, and that, when it met on February 1, 1816, that
decision was virtually irrevocable. We know, however, that the first
question was fully considered by the allied powers and the British
ministry before his place of exile was fixed, and Great Britain undertook
the custody of his person. The view which prevailed was that, after his
escape from Elba, he could neither be treated as an independent sovereign
nor as a subject of the French king, but must be regarded as a public
enemy who had fallen into the hands of one among several allied powers.
Accordingly, it was by their joint mandate that he remained the prisoner
of Great Britain, and was to be under the joint inspection of
commissioners appointed by the other powers. Still the minds of Liverpool,
Ellenborough, and Sir William Scott, judge of the court of admiralty, were
not altogether easy on the legal aspect of the case, which Eldon reviewed
in an elaborate and exhaustive memorandum. His conclusion was that
Napoleon's position was quite exceptional, that he could not rightly be
made over to France as a French rebel, but was a prisoner of war at the
disposal of the British government, both on the broad principles of
international law, and under the express terms of his surrender, as
reported officially by Captain Maitland of the <i>Bellerophon</i>.</p>

<p>It was thought expedient, however, to pass an act of parliament in the
session of 1816 for the purpose of setting at rest any objections which
might afterwards be raised. This measure was introduced on March 17 by
Lord Castlereagh, who defended it on grounds of national justice and
national policy. It met with no opposition in the house of commons, but
Lords<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span> Holland and Lauderdale criticised it in the house of lords, not as
sanctioning a wrong to Napoleon, but as implicitly admitting the right of
other powers to join in arrangements for his custody. Little attention was
then bestowed by parliament or the public on the moral aspect of his
life-long detention at St. Helena, the restrictions to be there imposed
upon his liberty, or the provision to be made for his comfort. Yet these
subjects have ever since exercised the minds of myriads both in England
and France, and have given birth to a copious literature for more than
three generations.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<h3>THE FIRST YEARS OF PEACE.</h3>


<p><a name="TOPIC_130" id="TOPIC_130"></a>When Parliament met on February 1, 1816, after a recess of unusual length,
Castlereagh was received with loud acclamations from all parts of the
house as the chief actor in the pacification of Europe. There was, of
course, a full debate upon the treaties, but the opposition dwelt less
upon the arbitrary partition of Europe than upon their alleged tendency to
guarantee sovereigns against the assertion of popular rights and upon the
manifest intention of the government to "raise the country into a military
power". From this moment dates the whig and radical watchword of "Peace,
Retrenchment, and Reform". The nation was, in fact, entering upon a period
of unprecedented depression and discontent, which lasted through the last
four years of George III.'s reign. At the close of 1815, however, the
whole horizon was apparently bright. Great Britain had saved Europe by her
example, and, however small her army in comparison with those of
continental states, she stood foremost among the powers which had crushed
the rule of Napoleon. Her national debt, it is true, had reached the
prodigious total of &pound;861,039,049, and the interest on it amounted
&pound;32,645,618, but the expansion of our national resources had kept pace
with it. In spite of the continental system, the orders in council, and
the American war, the imports and exports had enormously increased,
chiefly by means of an organised contraband traffic; the carrying trade of
the world had passed into the hands of British shipowners; British
manufactures were largely fostered by warlike expenditure at home and the
suspension of many industries abroad; while population, stimulated by a
vicious poor law, was rapidly on the increase. In this last element, then
considered as a sure<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span> sign of prosperity, really consisted one of the
chief national dangers.</p>

<p>So long as the war lasted, low as the rate of wages might be, there was
generally employment enough in the fields or in the factories for nearly
all the hands willing to labour. When the inflated war prices came to an
end, and wheat fell below 80s. or even 70s. a quarter, until it reached
52s. 6d. early in 1816, labourers were turned off and wages cut down still
further; bread was not proportionately cheapened, and agrarian outrages
sprang up. The continent, impoverished by the war, no longer required
British goods for military purposes, and, as its own domestic industries
revived, ceased to absorb British products, flung in profusion on its
markets. Hence came a reduction of 16 per cent. in the export trade, and
of nearly 20 per cent. in the import trade, which resulted in bankruptcies
and the dismissal of workpeople. If we add to these causes of distress,
the influence of over-speculation, the accession of disbanded soldiers to
the ranks of the unemployed, and the substitution of the factory system
with machinery for domestic manufactures with hand labour, we can partly
understand why Great Britain, never harried by invading armies, should
have suffered more than France itself from popular misery and disaffection
for several years after the restoration of peace.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>VANSITTART'S FINANCE.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_131" id="TOPIC_131"></a>The history of these years is mainly a history of social unrest, and
attempts to cure social evils by legislation or coercion. Liverpool and
his colleagues, with the possible exception of Eldon, were not bigoted
tories, and it is sometimes forgotten that among them, together with
Sidmouth, Castlereagh, and Vansittart, were Canning, Palmerston, and Peel.
One of the first parliamentary struggles was on the proposal of the
government to reduce the income tax from 10 to 5 per cent., and to apply
this half of it, producing about &pound;7,500,000, towards the expense of
maintaining an army of 150,000 men. Since the income tax has become a
favourite of democratic economists, as pressing specially upon the rich,
we may be surprised to find that its total repeal was successfully
advocated by Henry Brougham, the leading democrat of that day&mdash;a man whose
noble services to progress and to humanity in the earlier part of his
career have been obscured by the inordinate vanity and unprincipled
egotism which he displayed in the later phases of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span> his long public life.
He had entered parliament in 1810, and rapidly became the most active of
the opposition speakers. He now employed without scruple all the arts of
agitation, petition-framing, and parliamentary obstruction to achieve his
object, and succeeded, by the aid of bankers and country-gentlemen, in
defeating the government by a majority of thirty-seven. This vote might be
justified, more or less, on the principle laid down by Pitt, that the
income tax should be held in reserve as a war tax only, or on the ground
that it was equally wasteful and mischievous to keep up so large a
peace-establishment, especially if it might be used to bolster up
despotism abroad. It was also unfortunate that Castlereagh, ignoring the
heroic efforts made by the people of England for more than twenty years,
should have deprecated "an ignorant impatience to be relieved from the
pressure of taxation". Still, it is remarkable that friends of the people
and the ultra-liberal corporation of London, as it then was, should have
concentrated their indignant protests against the financial policy of the
government, not on the corn laws, or any other indirect tax, but on the
income tax.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_132" id="TOPIC_132"></a>Public confidence in the economic wisdom of the ministers was further
weakened by the gratuitous abandonment of the malt tax, apparently in a
fit of petulance, on the ground, explicitly stated, that, if another war
tax must be raised, two or three millions more or less would make little
difference. By a temporary suspension of the sinking fund, a deficit might
be converted into a surplus; Vansittart, however, neglected to take
advantage of this simple expedient, and raised &pound;11,500,000 by loan. His
waning reputation was almost shattered by this absurd proceeding. Finally,
the excessive and irregular expenditure upon the civil list provoked a
searching inquiry into its abuses, prefaced by a scathing attack from
Brougham upon the character of the prince regent. His character was, in
fact, indefensible, and had justly forfeited the respect of the nation. He
was a debauchee and gambler, a disobedient son, a cruel husband, a
heartless father, an ungrateful and treacherous friend, and a burden to
the ministries which had to act in his name and palliate his misdoings.
That of Liverpool carried a measure for the better regulation of the civil
list, upon which, swollen as it was by the wrongful appropriation of other
public funds,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span> many official salaries had been charged hitherto. For these
parliament now made a separate provision. The house of commons, which
properly grudged the prince regent the means of reckless luxury and
self-indulgence, was unanimous in voting &pound;60,000 for outfit and &pound;60,000 a
year to the Princess Charlotte on her marriage, on May 2, to Prince
Leopold of Saxe-Coburg, looking forward to a reign under which virtue and
a sense of public duty would again be the attributes of royalty. In this
session, too, it conferred a boon upon Ireland, which earned little
gratitude, by the consolidation of the British and Irish exchequers.
Ireland was virtually insolvent before this measure was passed. With the
union of the exchequers the union of the countries was completed. The
administration, discredited by its financial policy, was strengthened in
June by the acquisition of Canning, who succeeded Buckinghamshire as
president of the board of control. In September, 1814, Wellesley Pole, a
brother of the Marquis Wellesley and the Duke of Wellington, had been
admitted to the cabinet as master of the mint, so that with Castlereagh,
Vansittart, and Bragge-Bathurst, there were now five members of the
cabinet in the lower house.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>INDUSTRIAL RIOTS.</i></div>

<p>The disturbances which broke out again and again during the years 1816-19
were partly the outcome of sheer destitution among the working classes,
and partly of a growing demand for reform, whether constitutional or
revolutionary. The statesmen of the regency must not be too severely
judged if they often confounded these causes of seditious movements, and
failed to distinguish between the moderate and violent sections of
reformers. Those who remembered the bloodthirsty orgies of the French
revolution, ushered in by quixotic visions of liberty, equality, and
fraternity, may perhaps be excused for distrusting the moderate
professions of demagogues who deliberately inflamed the passions of
ignorant mobs. Moreover, the whigs and moderate reformers, who privately
condemned the excesses of their violent followers, made light of these in
their public utterances, and reserved all their censures for the
repressive policy of the government. Bread riots had begun before the
harvest, which proved a total failure. The price of wheat, which was as
low as 52s. 6d. a quarter in January, 1816, rose to 103s. 1d. in January,
1817, and to 111s. 6d. in June, 1817. And when rickburning set in as a
consequence of agricultural depression,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span> tumultuary processions as a
consequence of enforced idleness in the coal districts, and a revival of
Luddism as a consequence of stagnation in the various textile industries,
itself due to a glut of British goods on the continent, the reform party,
now raising its head, was held responsible by the government for a great
part of these disorders.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> The writings of Cobbett, especially his
<i>Weekly Register</i>, certainly had a wide influence in stirring up
discontent against existing institutions, but it must be admitted that he
condemned the use of physical force, and pointed to parliamentary reform
as the legitimate cure for all social evils. Reform, however, in Cobbett's
meaning included universal suffrage with annual parliaments, and the
Hampden clubs, all over the country, agitated for the same objects in less
guarded language. Still, looking back at these democratic agencies by the
light of later experience, we can hardly adopt the opinion expressed by a
secret committee of the house of commons that their avowed objects were
"nothing short of a revolution".</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_133" id="TOPIC_133"></a>It was on December 2, 1816, that the extreme section of reformers, now for
the first time known as radicals, in alliance with a body of socialists
called Spenceans, first came into open collision with the forces of the
law. A meeting was announced to be held on that day in Spa Fields,
Bermondsey, and was to be addressed by "Orator" Hunt, Major Cartwright,
the two Watsons, and other demagogues. Hunt was a gentleman of Somerset,
and had stood for Bristol in 1812. Though a prominent speaker, he in no
sense directed the movement. Burdett and Cochrane, the orthodox leaders of
London reformers, were not concerned in this demonstration, which,
according to an informer who gave evidence, was to be the signal for an
attack upon the Tower and other acts of atrocity. As it was, before Hunt
chose to appear, the mob, headed by the younger Watson, broke into
gunsmiths' shops, not without bloodshed, and marched through the Royal
Exchange, but were courageously met by the lord mayor, with a few
assistants, and very soon dispersed. The alarm produced<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span> in the whole
nation by this riotous fiasco was quite out of proportion to its real
importance, and was reawakened by an insult offered to the prince regent
on his return from opening parliament on January 28, 1817. Even Canning, a
life-long opponent of reform, did not scruple to magnify these and similar
evidences of popular restlessness into proofs of a deep-laid plot against
the constitution, and committees of both houses urged the necessity of
drastic measures to put down a conspiracy against public order and private
property. These measures took the form of bills for the suppression of
seditious meetings, and for the suspension until July 1 of the <i>habeas
corpus</i> act, which had been uninterruptedly in force since its suspension
by Pitt had expired in 1801. This last bill was passed on March 3, and,
before the other became law, the so-called march of the Blanketeers took
place at Manchester. The march was the ridiculous sequel of a very large
meeting got up for the purpose of carrying a petition to London, and
presenting it to the prince regent in person. The meeting was dispersed by
the soldiers and police, after the riot act had been read, and a
straggling crowd of some three hundred who began their pilgrimage,
carrying blankets or overcoats, melted away by degrees before they had got
far southward.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>SIDMOUTH'S UNPOPULARITY.</i></div>

<p>A far more serious outbreak at Manchester seems to have been clumsily
planned soon afterwards, but it ended in nothing, and the enemies of the
government freely attributed this and other projects of mob violence to
the instigation of an <i>agent-provocateur</i>, well known as "Oliver the Spy".
This man was also credited with the authorship of "the Derbyshire
insurrection," for which three men were executed and many others
transported. Here there can be no doubt that a formidable gang, armed with
pikes, terrorised a large district, pressing operatives to join them in
overt defiance of the law, and killing one who held back. Being confronted
by a Nottinghamshire magistrate named Rolleston, with a small body of
soldiers, they fled across the fields, and the bubble of rebellion burst
at a touch. Whether they were legally guilty of high treason, for which
they were unwisely tried, may perhaps be doubted, but it would certainly
be no palliation of their crime if it could be shown, as it never was
shown, that Oliver had led them to rely on a jacobin revolution in London.
What does appear very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span> clearly is that Sidmouth was greatly alarmed by the
reports of his agents on the disturbed state of the country, but that he
was highly conscientious in his instructions and in the use of his own
powers. The great majority of those imprisoned for political offences at
this time were liberated or acquitted, but the suspension of the <i>habeas
corpus</i> act was renewed at the beginning of July.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_134" id="TOPIC_134"></a>Moreover, a circular was addressed by Sidmouth to the lords-lieutenant of
counties, for the information of the magistrates, intimating that, in the
opinion of the law officers, persons charged on oath with seditious libel
might be apprehended and held to bail. No act of Sidmouth called forth
such an outburst of reprobation as this; yet it is not self-evident that
instigations to outrage, being criminal offences, should be treated by
magistrates differently from other offences for which bail may be
required, with the alternative of imprisonment. On the other hand, it is
hardly becoming for a home secretary to interpret the law, and, since the
forensic triumphs of Erskine, it had been declared by an act of parliament
that in cases of libel, as distinct from all other criminal trials, both
the law and the fact were within the province of the jury. At all events,
William Cobbett, feeling himself to be at the mercy of informers and the
crown, took refuge in America in December, 1817. Hone, an antiquarian
bookseller, was thrice prosecuted for blasphemous libels, in which the
ministers had been held up to contempt. All these ill-judged, if not
vindictive, prosecutions ended in signal failure. Ellenborough, the chief
justice, before whom the two last trials were held, strained his judicial
authority to procure a conviction of Hone, but the prisoner, with a spirit
worthy of a martyr, defied the intimidation of the court, and thrice
carried the sympathies of the jury with him. His triple acquittal led to
Ellenborough's resignation, and perceptibly shook the prestige of the
government.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_135" id="TOPIC_135"></a>In the year 1818 there was a temporary improvement in the economic
condition of the country. The depression of the preceding year was
followed in this year by a rapid increase of revenue. The importance the
ministry attached to finance was emphasised by the admission to the
cabinet in January of Frederick John Robinson, afterwards prime minister
as Lord Goderich, who had been appointed president of the board of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span> trade
and treasurer of the navy. The chancellor of the exchequer and the master
of the mint were already members of the cabinet. The suspension of the
<i>habeas corpus</i> act having expired, the reform agitation revived, but
assumed a less dangerous character, and no serious outbreak occurred. A
bill of indemnity was passed to cover any excesses of jurisdiction in
arresting suspected persons or in suppressing tumultuous assemblies. A
parliamentary inquiry showed both that the disorders of the previous year
had been exaggerated, and that, after all, the extraordinary powers of the
home office had been used with moderation. Nevertheless, the early part of
the session was largely occupied by party debates on these questions, the
employment of spies, and apprehensions for libel. Parliament was dissolved
in June, and the general election which followed resulted in a gain of
several seats to the opposition.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> The ministry was strengthened in
January, 1819, by the appointment of Wellington to be master-general of
the ordnance, in succession to Mulgrave, who remained in the cabinet
without office.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE "MANCHESTER MASSACRE".</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_136" id="TOPIC_136"></a>Before the end of the year 1818, a strike of Manchester cotton-spinners
was attended by the usual incidents of brutal violence towards workmen who
refused to join in it, but a few shots from the soldiers, one of which
killed a rioter, proved effectual in quelling lawlessness. Manchester,
however, remained the centre of agitation, and during the summer of 1819 a
series of reform meetings held in other great towns culminated in a
monster meeting originally convened for August 9, but postponed until the
16th. The history of this meeting ending in the so-called "Manchester" or
"Peterloo massacre," has been strongly coloured by party spirit and
sympathy with the victims of reckless demagogy no less than of blundering
officialism. It is certain that drilling had been going on for some time
among the multitudes invited to attend the meeting of the 9th; that its
avowed object was to choose a "legislatorial representative," as
Birmingham had already done, and that, on its being declared illegal by
the municipal authorities, who declined to summon it on their own
initiative, its organisers deliberately resolved to hold it a week later,
whether it were legal or not.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span></p>

<p>The contingents, which poured in by thousands from neighbouring towns,
seem to have carried no arms but sticks, and to have conducted themselves
peaceably when they arrived at St. Peter's Fields, where Orator Hunt,
puffed up with silly vanity, was voted into the chair on a hustings.
Unfortunately, instead of attempting to prevent the meeting, the county
magistrates decided to let the great masses of people assemble, and then
to arrest the leaders in the midst of them. They had at their disposal
several companies of infantry, six troops of the 15th hussars, and a body
of yeomanry, besides special constables. The chief constable, being
ordered to arrest Hunt and his colleagues, declared that he could not do
so without military aid, whereupon a small force of yeomanry advanced but
soon became wedged up and enclosed by the densely packed crowd. One of the
magistrates, fancying the yeomanry to be in imminent danger, of which
there is no proof, called upon Colonel L'Estrange, who was in command of
the soldiers, to rescue them and disperse the mob. Four troops of the
hussars then made a dashing charge, supported by a few of the yeomanry;
the people fled in wild confusion before them; some were cut down, more
were trampled down, and an eye-witness describes "several mounds of human
beings" as lying where they had fallen. Happily, the actual loss of life
did not exceed five or six, but a much larger number was more or less
wounded, the real havoc and bloodshed were inevitably exaggerated by
rumour, and a bitter sense of resentment was implanted in the breasts of
myriads, innocent of the slightest complicity with sedition, but impatient
of oligarchical rule, and disgusted with so ruthless an interference with
the right of public meeting.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_137" id="TOPIC_137"></a>It would have been wise if Sidmouth and his colleagues had recognised this
widespread feeling, had seen that famine and despair were at the bottom of
popular discontent, and had admitted error of judgment, at least, on the
part of the Lancashire magistrates. On the contrary, they felt it so
necessary to support civil and military authority, at all hazards, that
they induced the prince regent to express unqualified approbation of the
course taken, and afterwards defended it without reserve in parliament.
Even Eldon expressed his opinion privately that it would be hard to
justify it, unless the assembly amounted to an act of treason, as he
regarded it; whereas Hunt and his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span> associates were prosecuted (and
convicted in the next year) not for treason, but only for a misdemeanour.
At all events, the storm of indignation excited by this sad event, and not
confined to the working classes, powerfully fomented the reform movement.
Large meetings were held over all the manufacturing districts, and a
requisition to summon a great Yorkshire meeting was signed by Fitzwilliam,
the lord-lieutenant, who attended it in person. For these acts he was
properly dismissed, but, in spite of inflammatory speeches, nearly all the
meetings passed off quietly and without interference. Nevertheless, the
government thought it necessary to hold an autumn session, and strengthen
the hands of the executive by fresh measures of repression. These having
been passed in December after strenuous opposition, were afterwards known
as the six acts, and regarded as the climax of Sidmouth's despotic
<i>r&eacute;gime</i>.</p>

<p>Two of the six acts, directed against the possession of arms and military
training for unlawful purposes, cannot be considered oppressive under the
circumstances then prevailing. Nor can exception be taken on the ground of
principle to another for "preventing delay in the administration of
justice in cases of misdemeanour," which, indeed, was amended, by Holland,
with Eldon's consent, so as to benefit defendants in state prosecutions.
Two were designed to curb still further the liberty of the press. One of
these made the publication of seditious libels an offence punishable with
banishment, and authorised the seizure of all unsold copies. When we
consider the extreme virulence of seditious libels in those days, this act
does not wear so monstrous an aspect as its radical opponents alleged, but
happily it soon became a dead letter, and was repealed in 1830. The other,
imposing a stamp-duty on small pamphlets, only placed them on the same
footing with newspapers. The last of the new measures&mdash;"to prevent more
effectually seditious meetings and assemblies"&mdash;was practically aimed
against all large meetings, unless called by the highest authorities in
counties and corporate towns, or, at least, five justices of the peace. It
was, therefore, a grave encroachment on the right of public meeting, and
the only excuse for it was that it was passed under the fear of a
revolutionary movement, and limited in duration to a period of five years.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>SOCIAL LEGISLATION.</i></div>

<p>Nor can it be denied that, as a whole, this restrictive code<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span> was
successful. From a modern point of view it may appear less arbitrary than
the suspension of the <i>habeas corpus</i> act for a whole year (1817-18), but
it was assuredly tainted with a reactionary spirit, and was capable of
being worked in a way inconsistent with civil liberty. That it was not so
worked, on the whole, and caused less hardship than had been anticipated,
was not so much the result of changes in the government itself, as of
economic progress in the nation, aided by a healthier growth of public
opinion. The violence which marked the early stages of the reform movement
has been described as a safety-valve against anarchy; it was, in reality,
the chief obstacle to a sound and comprehensive reform bill. While it
lasted, the middle classes and liberals of moderate views were estranged
from the cause; when it ceased, the demand for a new representative system
became irresistible.</p>

<p>Whatever allowance may be made for the coercive policy of the government
during the dark period of storm and stress which succeeded the great war,
it is hard to find any excuse for its neglect of social legislation. Then,
if ever, was a time when the work of Pitt's best days should have been
resumed, when real popular grievances should have been redressed, and when
the long arrears of progressive reform should have been gradually
redeemed. Yet very little was done to better the lot of men, women, and
children in Great Britain, and that little was chiefly initiated by
individuals. In 1816, on the motion of a private member, an inquiry was
commenced into the state of the metropolitan police, which disclosed most
scandalous abuses, such as the habitual association of thieves and
thief-takers, encouraged by the grants of blood-money which had been
continued since the days of Jonathan Wild. In 1817 a committee sanctioned
by the ministers recommended a measure for the gradual abolition of
sinecures, which then figured prominently in the domestic charter of
reform. Their recommendations were adopted, and a large number of sinecure
offices were swept away. But inasmuch as sinecures had been largely given
to persons who had held public offices of business, it was thought
necessary to institute pensions to an amount not exceeding one-half of the
reduction. In 1816 a private member, named Curwen, brought forward a
fanciful scheme of his own for the amendment of the poor laws, which in
effect anticipated modern projects<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span> of old age pensions. He obtained the
appointment of a select committee, which reported in 1817, but their
proposals were thoroughly inadequate, and no sensible improvement came of
them.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_138" id="TOPIC_138"></a>It was also in 1816 that the cause of national education, the importance
of which had been vainly urged by Whitbread, was taken up in earnest by
Brougham. His motion for the appointment of a select committee was
confined to the schools of the metropolis. It sat at intervals until 1818,
when its powers were enlarged, and its labours somewhat diverted into a
searching exposure of mismanagement in endowed charities. The one direct
fruit of the committee was the creation of the charity commission, but in
the opinion of Brougham himself it was of the highest value in opening the
whole education question. The almost universal prevalence of distress in
1817, and the excessive burden thrown upon poor rates, induced parliament
to authorise an expenditure of &pound;750,000 in Great Britain and Ireland for
the employment of the labouring poor on public works. A far sounder and
more fruitful measure of relief owes its origin to the same year. It was
now that the institution of savings banks, hitherto promoted only by
single philanthropists, emerged from the experimental stage and claimed
the attention of parliament. A bill for their regulation, introduced by
Pitt's friend, George Rose, did not pass into an act; but the
establishment of savings banks was now directly encouraged by the
legislature, and there were thoughtful men who already dimly foresaw the
manifold benefits of their future development.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE CURRENCY QUESTION.</i></div>

<p>In the year 1819 was initiated a very important reform in the currency,
which had long been delayed. When the bullion committee reported in 1810,
Bank of England notes were at a discount of about 13&frac12; per cent. There
were several reasons why this should be the case. Continental trade was
then compelled to pass through British ports, and a large supply of gold
was needed to serve as the medium of this trade. There was also a steady
drain of gold to the Spanish peninsula to meet war expenses, while
troubles in South America diminished the annual output of the precious
metals. In 1811 Bank of England notes were made legal tender, but no
further action was then taken, and the depreciation continued until 1814.
The magnificent harvest of 1813, together with other causes, brought<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
about a sudden fall of prices, in consequence of which no less than 240
country banks stopped payment in the years 1814-16. The decrease and
popular distrust of private banknotes produced an increased demand for
Bank of England notes, which in 1817 had nearly risen in value to a par
with gold. In 1819, when they were at a discount of only 4&frac12; per cent.,
a committee was appointed by the house of commons to reconsider the policy
of resuming cash payments, and Peel, young as he was, became its chairman.
In this character he abandoned his preconceived views and induced the
house to adopt those which had been advocated by Horner. It was not
thought prudent to fix an earlier date than 1823 for the actual resumption
of cash payments, but the directors of the Bank of England anticipated
this date, and began to exchange notes for specie on May 1, 1821. The new
standard was definitely one of gold. A considerable fall of prices ensued,
and it is still a disputed question whether the return to a single
standard was entirely beneficial.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_139" id="TOPIC_139"></a>But for what is called the public, the readers of newspapers and the
frequenters of clubs or taverns, the rivalry of party leaders or the
incidents of court life excite a much keener interest than painful efforts
for the good of the humbler classes. During the closing years of George
III.'s reign there were no party conflicts of special intensity. The whigs
acquiesced in their self-imposed exclusion from office, and contented
themselves with damaging criticism; the radicals had not yet acquired the
confidence or respect of the electors. Liverpool remained prime minister;
Castlereagh, foreign secretary; Sidmouth, home secretary; Vansittart,
chancellor of the exchequer. Meanwhile there were startling vicissitudes
in the fortunes of the royal family. The king, indeed, remained under the
cloud of mental derangement which darkened the last ten years of his life,
and the Princess of Wales, who had been the object of so much scandal, was
now out of sight and residing abroad. The Princess Charlotte, however, the
only daughter of the regent, had centred in herself the loyalty and hopes
of the nation in a remarkable degree, and was credited, not unjustly, with
private virtues and public sympathies contrasting strongly with the
disposition of her father. Her marriage with Prince Leopold of
Saxe-Coburg, who bore<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span> a high character, had been hailed with national
enthusiasm, for it was known that, like Queen Victoria, she had been
carefully trained and had disciplined herself, physically and morally, for
the duties of a throne. It has been truly said that her death in
childbirth, on November 6, was the great historical event of 1817. The
prince regent, with his constitution weakened by dissipation, was not
expected to survive her long, and so long as his wife lived there was no
prospect of other legitimate issue, unless he could procure a divorce.
There was no grandchild of George III. who could lawfully inherit the
crown, and the apprehension of a collateral succession became more and
more generally felt.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_140" id="TOPIC_140"></a>In the following year four royal marriages were announced. The Princess
Elizabeth espoused the Landgrave of Hesse-Homburg; the Duke of Clarence,
the Princess Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen; the Duke of Cambridge, the
Princess Augusta of Hesse; the Duke of Kent, the Princess Victoria Mary of
Saxe-Coburg. The Duke of Sussex was already married, but not with the
necessary consent of the crown, and the Duke of Cumberland was childless,
having married three years earlier a divorced widow whom the queen, for
private reasons, declined to receive. It is a striking proof of the
discredit into which the royal family had fallen, since the old king
virtually ceased<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span> to reign, that parliament, in spite of its anxiety about
the succession, displayed an almost niggardly parsimony when it was moved
to increase the allowances of the princes about to marry. No application
was made on behalf of the Princess Elizabeth or the Duke of Sussex, who
was already married morganatically. The additional grant of &pound;6,000 a year
asked on behalf of the Duke of Cumberland was refused by a small majority,
partly, no doubt, because his anti-liberal opinions and untrustworthy
character were no secret to public men. &pound;10,000 a year was asked for the
Duke of Clarence, and justified by Canning as less than he might fairly
have claimed, but it was reduced to &pound;6,000 and declined by the duke as
inadequate; he afterwards married without a parliamentary grant. The
provision of &pound;6,000 a year for the Dukes of Cambridge and Kent
respectively was stoutly opposed but ultimately carried. Of all George
III.'s sons, the Duke of Kent was perhaps the most respected. It has been
truly said that if the nation could have expressed its dearest wish, in
the spirit of prophecy, after the death of the Princess Charlotte, it
would have been that the issue of the Duke of Kent's marriage with Prince
Leopold's sister might succeed, as Queen Victoria, to the crown of her
grandfather.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE DEATH OF GEORGE III.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_141" id="TOPIC_141"></a>On November 17, 1818, Queen Charlotte died, having filled her great and
most difficult position for nearly sixty years with sound judgment,
exemplary moral integrity, and a certain homely dignity. The Duke of York
succeeded her as guardian of the king's person. Little more than a year
later she was followed to the grave by the Duke of Kent, who died on
January 23, 1820, and by the king himself, who died on January 29, in the
eighty-second year of his age. He was not a great sovereign, but, as a
man, he was far superior to his two predecessors, and must ever stand
high, if not highest, in the gallery of our kings. His venerable figure,
though shrouded from view, was a chief mainstay of the monarchy. Narrow as
his views were, and obstinately as he adhered to them, he was not
incapable of changing them, and could show generosity towards enemies, as
he ever showed fidelity to friends. His reception of Franklin after the
American war, and of Fox after the death of Pitt, was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span> that of a king who
understood his kingly office; and his strict devotion to business,
regardless of his own pleasure, could not have been exceeded by a merchant
engrossed in lucrative trade. The many pithy and racy sayings recorded of
him show an insight into men's characters and the realities of life not
unworthy of Dr. Johnson. His simplicity, kindliness, and charity endeared
him to his subjects. His undaunted courage and readiness to undertake sole
responsibility, not only during the panics of the Gordon riots and of the
impending French invasion, but in many a political crisis, compelled the
respect of all his ministers, and his disappearance from the scenes, to
make way for the regency of his eldest son, was almost as disastrous for
English society as the exchange, in France, of Louis XIV.'s decorous rule
for that of the Regent Orl&eacute;ans.</p>

<p>The European concert which had been called into existence by the war
against Napoleon, and had effected a continental settlement at Vienna,
continued to act for the maintenance of peace. The treaty of alliance of
1815 only bound the four powers to common action in the event of a fresh
revolution in France which might endanger the tranquillity of other
states. The holy alliance was more comprehensive and wider in its aims,
but was too vague to form the practical basis of a federation. The
settlement of Europe by the treaty of Vienna was, however, the work of all
the powers, and they had therefore an interest in everything that might be
likely to affect that settlement. The habit of concerted action, once
formed, was not lightly abandoned, and the succeeding age was an age of
congresses. But though there was a general sentiment in favour of
concerted action it manifested itself in different ways. The causes of the
recent struggle with France had been political in their origin, and it was
agreed that a recurrence of disorder from France could be best prevented
by the establishment of a government in that country which should be at
once constitutional and legitimist. England favoured, and Russia, the most
autocratic of states, favoured still more vehemently, the development of
constitutions wherever it might be practicable, while Austria, being
composed of territories with no national cohesion, endeavoured rather to
thwart the growth of constitutions. But Russia was also the most active
advocate of joint interference where a constitutional reform was effected
by unconstitutional<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span> means. Great Britain and Austria, on the other hand,
with a juster instinct, considered armed interference an extreme remedy
which might often be worse than the disease of a revolution.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>ROYALIST REACTION IN EUROPE.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_142" id="TOPIC_142"></a>The numerous restorations of 1814 and 1815 were followed by a royalist and
aristocratic reaction in many countries of Europe. In France Louis XVIII.
found himself confronted by an ultra-royalist chamber of deputies which
clamoured for vengeance on the partisans of the republican and imperial
<i>r&eacute;gimes</i> and for the restoration of the privileges and estates of the
Church. Ferdinand VII. of Spain swept away the unwieldy constitution of
1812 amid the rejoicings of his people, who little foresaw his future
tyranny; and Great Britain did not venture to resist the action of
Ferdinand of the Two Sicilies in abolishing a constitution which British
influence had induced him to grant his island kingdom in 1813. In Prussia
the government dealt sternly with the liberal press, and the provincial
estates opposed the institution of a national diet; while in W&uuml;rtemberg a
parliament assembled under a liberal constitution demanded the restoration
of the ancient privileges of the nobility and clergy. In the Two Sicilies
British influence, supported by that of Austria, was used to prevent
outrages on the defeated party; in Spain the moderate counsels of Great
Britain were less successful. Austria endeavoured to prevent future
disturbance in the Italian peninsula by a secret treaty, which obtained
the sanction of the British government, requiring the Two Sicilies to
adopt no constitutional changes inconsistent with the principles adopted
by Austria in the Lombardo-Venetian kingdom. Similar treaties were
concluded by Austria with Tuscany, Modena, and Parma, and she thus gained
an ascendency in Italy, from which only Sardinia and the papal states were
exempt. Russian agents meanwhile began to conduct a liberal propaganda in
Spain and Italy, and Russia was even credited with a desire to make a
liberalised Spain a counterpoise to England on the sea.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_143" id="TOPIC_143"></a>For a time, however, there were no European complications of a formidable
nature. In 1816 a British squadron was sent out under Lord Exmouth lo
execute the decree of the congress of Vienna against the Barbary states.
The Dey of Algiers and the Beys of Tunis and Tripoli were called upon to
recognise the Ionian Islands as British, to accept British media<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>tion
between them and the courts of the Two Sicilies and Sardinia, to restore
their Christian captives, and not to authorise further piracy. These terms
were accepted by the Beys of Tunis and Tripoli, and the two first demands
were granted by the Dey of Algiers. He was allowed a delay of three months
in order to obtain the sultan's permission for granting the remainder, but
in the interval a massacre of Italian fishermen took place at Bona. Lord
Exmouth now sailed from Gibraltar to attack Algiers. On his demands being
again ignored, he bombarded that city on August 27 for more than six
hours. The arsenal and storehouses and all the ships in the port were
burned, and on the next day the dey accepted Exmouth's terms; peace was
signed on the 30th, the principal terms being the abolition of Christian
slavery, and the delivery of all slaves to Exmouth on the following day.</p>

<p>The treaty of Vienna in placing the Ionian Islands under British
protection had made no mention of the towns of Parga and Butrinto on the
mainland of Epirus which had passed under British rule along with the
islands. These places were now surrendered to Turkey in accordance with a
former treaty, in return for the Turkish recognition of the British
protectorate over the islands. The inhabitants of Parga were, however,
vehemently opposed to such a transference of their allegiance, and they
were conveyed to the Ionian Islands and compensated for the loss of their
property. The Turks entered into occupation of Parga in 1819. In 1817 and
1818 wild rumours of Russian aggression in the direction of the
Mediterranean began to circulate in England. It was reported that Spain
had promised to cede Port Mahon to Russia; and that Russia was preparing a
great military force, to be employed, if necessary, in alliance with the
Bourbon states, France, Spain, and the Two Sicilies, to counteract British
and Austrian influence. This influence, with that of Prussia, had really
been employed to keep the Dardanelles closed against Russian ships.
Meanwhile Austria had won over Prussia to her conservative policy in
Germany.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_144" id="TOPIC_144"></a>The violent language of the liberal party, especially at the universities,
already began to terrify the Prussian government. The first danger signal
was given at the Wartburg festival of delegates from the German
universities in 1817, at which the students indulged in some boyish
manifestations of their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span> sympathies; their proceedings made some stir in
Germany, and Metternich declared that they were revolutionary. The horror
of liberalism was destined to be heightened in 1819 by the murder of the
tsar's agent, the dramatist Kotzebue, by a lunatic member of a political
society at Giessen. Its immediate result was a conference of German
ministers at Carlsbad, where several resolutions for the suppression of
political agitation were passed, and afterwards adopted by the diet at
Frankfort. This policy was embodied in the "final act" of a similar
conference held at Vienna in the following year (1820), which empowered
the greater states of Germany to aid the smaller in checking revolutionary
movements. At the same time it reaffirmed the general principle of
non-intervention, and even laid down the pregnant doctrine that
constitutions could not be legitimately altered except by constitutional
means. The union of Austria and Prussia on the conservative side had
rather the effect of throwing the secondary states of southern Germany
upon the liberal side. In the spring and summer of 1818 Bavaria and Baden
framed constitutions, and in 1819 W&uuml;rtemberg once more essayed
parliamentary government, which the reactionary policy of her first
parliament had compelled her to abandon. The significant fact in European
politics was that Frederick William III. of Prussia, always accustomed to
being led, had passed from the influence of Russia to that of Austria.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE CONFERENCE OF AIX-LA-CHAPELLE.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_145" id="TOPIC_145"></a>Such were the general tendencies of European politics when the conference
of Aix-la-Chapelle assembled on September 30, 1818. The primary object of
this conference was to consider the request of France for a reduction in
the indemnity demanded of her and for the evacuation of her territories by
the four allied powers. Wellington and Castlereagh, who represented Great
Britain, earned the gratitude of France by readily agreeing to these
requests, which were granted without any difficulty. This question was
obviously one which required such a conference to settle it; but the
conference, having once assembled, was urged to deal with other
difficulties that less directly concerned it. One of these was a dispute
between Denmark and Sweden about the apportionment of the Danish debt,
which, in consideration of the annexation of Norway to Sweden, under the
treaty of Kiel, was to be partly borne by Sweden. Denmark appealed to the
four powers, representing that treaty as in fact a part of their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span> own
settlement of Europe. Sweden would not admit the right of the powers to
intervene, but finally settled her difficulty with Denmark by a separate
negotiation conducted by the mediation of Great Britain in 1819.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_146" id="TOPIC_146"></a>A still more doubtful question was raised by the request of Spain for the
assistance of the allied powers against her revolted colonies. The Spanish
dependencies in America had declined to acknowledge Joseph Bonaparte, and
had lapsed into a state of chaos; the restoration of Ferdinand VII. had
induced most of them to return to their allegiance, but the three
south-eastern colonies, Banda Oriental (Uruguay), La Plata (the
Argentine), and Paraguay, continued in revolt. In 1817 fortune turned
still further against Spain; Monte Video, the capital of Banda Oriental,
was taken by Portugal, or rather by Brazil, and Chile revolted against
Spain. On February 12, 1818, Chile proclaimed her independence, and she
began at once to procure warships in England and the United States, of
which Lord Cochrane took command. The four allied powers and France had
protested against the seizure of Monte Video, but otherwise Spain had been
left to herself. Great Britain seemed to have more to gain than to lose by
the insurrection. The revolted colonies were open to her commerce, and by
weakening Spain they had strengthened the maritime supremacy of Great
Britain. Nevertheless Great Britain was willing to mediate, on condition
that Spain would make reasonable concessions. Spain, however, refused to
make any concessions at all, and called on the allied powers to aid her in
crushing the insurrection by force. Great Britain did not regard an
unconditional subjection of the colonies as either expedient or
practicable, and opposed this course; Austria took the same view, and thus
placed intervention out of the question.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE EUROPEAN ALLIANCE.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_147" id="TOPIC_147"></a>But the principal question before the conference of Aix-la-Chapelle was
not one relating to any particular difficulty, but the permanent form of
the European alliance. The tsar desired a general confederacy of European
powers, such as had signed the treaty of Vienna and the holy alliance.
This confederacy was to guard against two evils&mdash;that of revolutionary
agitation and that of arbitrary administration and sectional alliances.
Such a project, though doubtless proposed in good faith, practically gave
Russia an interest in the domestic movements, both<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span> reactionary and
constitutional, of every country, while it forbade any political
combination to which Russia was not a party. Castlereagh agreed with
Metternich in thinking that such an extension of Russian Influence was
more to be dreaded than local disorder, and Great Britain and Austria
proposed therefore that the alliance should be based on the treaty of
Chaumont, as renewed at Vienna and Paris, though they were willing to have
friendly discussions from time to time without extending the scope of the
alliance. All parties desired to include France in their alliance, but the
tsar pertinently objected that France could not be admitted to an alliance
aimed solely against France. A compromise was therefore adopted. The
quadruple alliance for war, in case of a revolution in France, was
secretly renewed, and centres for mobilisation were fixed, while France
was publicly invited to join the deliberations of the allied powers. A
secret protocol was then signed providing for the meeting of congresses
from time to time, and giving the minor European powers a place in these
congresses when their affairs should be under discussion.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<h3>THE LAST YEARS OF LORD LIVERPOOL.</h3>


<p>The only important events of domestic interest in the year 1820, after the
death of George III., were the Cato Street conspiracy, and the so-called
trial of Queen Caroline. For the accession of the king, who had so long
exercised royal functions as regent, produced no visible effect either on
the personal composition or on the general policy of the government.
Immediately after his proclamation he was attacked by a dangerous illness,
but on his recovery he promptly raised two questions which nearly involved
a change of ministry. One of these was a proposal to increase his private
revenue, which he was induced to abandon for the present. The other was a
demand for a divorce, which the ministers firmly resisted, though they
ultimately agreed to a compromise, under which the divorce question was to
be deferred, so long as the queen remained quietly abroad, but action was
to be taken in case she returned to assert her rights.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE CATO STREET CONSPIRACY.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_148" id="TOPIC_148"></a>In the midst of these difficulties the lives of the ministers were
threatened by a plot somewhat like those of the seventeenth century. Later
writers have represented it as contemptible in its conception, and as
directly provoked by the "Manchester massacre". So it may be said that Guy
Fawkes was an insignificant person, and that his employers were
exasperated by the severe treatment of popish recusants. The facts are
that Arthur Thistlewood, the author of the Cato Street conspiracy, was a
well-known confederate of the Watsons and other members of the extreme
reform party, and that his plan for murdering the assembled cabinet in a
private house would probably have been effectual, had it not been detected
by the aid of an informer. This informer, Edwards, had warned the
authorities in Novem<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>ber, 1819, of the impending stroke, and may or may
not have instigated Thistlewood's gang to execute it at a moment and place
well-calculated to secure their arrest. At all events twenty-four
conspirators armed themselves in Cato Street, near the Edgware Road,
London, for the purpose of assassinating the ministers at a cabinet dinner
in Harrowby's house in Grosvenor Square, and some of their associates were
posted near the door of that house to summon them when the guests should
have assembled. Harrowby's dinner was of course put off, but the watchers
were deceived by the arrival of carriages for a dinner party next door,
and failed to apprise the gang in Cato Street. The police rushed in upon
the gang, but a body of soldiers ordered to support them reached the spot
too late, a policeman was stabbed, and Thistlewood, with twelve or
fourteen others, contrived to escape. He was captured the next morning,
and executed with four of his accomplices, five more were transported for
life, and the atrocity of the enterprise was naturally treated in the
king's speech as a justification for the repressive measures in operation.
In the following April a petty outbreak in Scotland was easily put down by
a few troops at a place called Bonnymuir. It was, however, preceded by a
treasonable proclamation, which spread terror among the citizens of
Glasgow for several hours, and was sufficiently like an attempt at armed
rebellion to confirm the alarm excited by the Cato Street conspiracy. In
the face of such warnings, the energy of the government in stamping out
disorder could hardly be censured.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_149" id="TOPIC_149"></a>The last parliament of George III. was prorogued on February 28, 1820, and
dissolved on the following day. One of its last debates was on Lord John
Russell's proposal to suspend the issue of writs to the boroughs of
Grampound, Penryn, Barnstaple, and Camelford. This was carried in the
house of commons, but lost in the house of lords. The new parliament was
opened by George IV. in person on April 21. Widespread excitement
occasioned by the question of the divorce prevented the business of the
first session from attracting much attention. A deficit in the revenue,
coinciding with growing expenditure, compelled Vansittart to fall back on
a fresh manipulation of the sinking fund. One measure, however, of the
highest importance was introduced by Brougham. The committee of 1814 on
national education had amassed a great body of valuable evidence,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span> and he
now founded upon its report a comprehensive bill extending to the whole
country. It placed the management and teaching of elementary schools
entirely in the hands of Churchmen, and was dropped after the first
reading, but the conscience of the nation was roused by it, and it bore
fruit later. Further slight mitigations of the criminal law were carried
as a result of attacks made by Sir James Mackintosh, upon whom the mantle
of Romilly had fallen, and it is worthy of notice that even Eldon, the
stout opponent of such mitigations, condemned the use of spring-guns, as a
safeguard against poaching. The only ministerial change in this year was
the final retirement in May of Lord Mulgrave, who had held high office in
every ministry except that of Grenville since 1804, and had voluntarily
surrendered his post at the head of the ordnance in 1818 to make room for
Wellington.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>QUEEN CAROLINE.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_150" id="TOPIC_150"></a>The "queen's trial," as it is erroneously called, was the last act but one
in a domestic tragedy which had lasted twenty-five years. The Princess
Caroline of Brunswick was a frivolous and ill-disciplined young woman when
she was selected by George III. as a wife for the heir-apparent, already
united and really attached to Mrs. Fitzherbert. The princess could not
have been married to a man less capable of drawing out the better side of
her character, nor was she one to inspire his selfish and heartless nature
with a sentiment, if not of conjugal love, yet of conjugal friendship.
From the first there was no pretence of affection between them. A few
years after her marriage she was relegated, not unwillingly, to live
independently at Blackheath, where many eminent men accepted her
hospitality. During this period, as we have seen, a "delicate
investigation" into her conduct was instituted in 1806. Though she emerged
from it with less stain on her character than had been expected, she never
enjoyed the respect of the royal family or of the nation, and there was no
question of her sharing the home of her husband. Instead of being a bond
of concord between them, the education of her daughter was the subject of
constant discord, requiring the frequent intervention of the old king
until he lost his reason. After she went abroad in 1814, she travelled
widely, but her English attendants soon retired from her service, and she
incurred fresh suspicion by her flighty and undignified conduct. She had
no part in the rejoicing for the marriage, or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span> in the mourning for the
death, of the Princess Charlotte; and in 1818 a secret commission,
afterwards known as the Milan commission, was sent out by the prince
regent to collect evidence for a divorce suit. Not only Liverpool, but
Eldon, who had formerly stood her friend, concurred in the appointment of
this commission, promoted by Sir John Leach, and its report was the
foundation of the proceedings now taken against her.</p>

<p>These proceedings were immediately due to her own action in returning to
England in June, 1820, but this action was not wholly unprovoked. She had
long and bitterly resented her official exclusion from foreign courts, and
when, after the king's accession, her name was omitted from the
prayer-book, she protested against it as an intolerable insult. Contrary
to the advice of her wisest partisans, including Brougham, she persisted
in braving the wrath of the king and throwing herself upon the people. She
was received at Dover with acclamations from immense multitudes; and her
journey to and through London was a continued ovation. Not that her
innocence was established even in the popular mind, but that, innocent or
guilty, she was regarded as a persecuted woman, and persecuted by a
worthless husband. The ministry fulfilled its promise to the king by
moving the house of lords to institute an inquiry into the queen's
conduct. Pending this, conferences took place between Wellington and
Castlereagh, on the part of the king, and Brougham and Denman on that of
the queen. It was at once laid down as a preliminary basis of the
negotiation that neither should the king be understood to retract, nor the
queen to admit, any allegation against her. The points upon which she
inflexibly insisted were, the recognition of her royal status at foreign
courts, through an official introduction by the British ambassador, and
the insertion of her name in the prayer-book.</p>

<p>The house of commons, on the motion of Wilberforce, offered to protect her
honour (whatever that might import) on condition of her waiving this last
point, but she courteously declined its conciliatory proposals on June 22.
On July 4 a secret committee of the house of lords recommended a solemn
investigation, to be carried out "in the course of a legislative
proceeding," and on the 8th Liverpool introduced a bill of pains and
penalties, to deprive her of her title, and to dissolve her marriage. The
second reading of this bill was formally set down for August<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span> 17, and for
several weeks afterwards the house of lords was occupied in hearing
evidence in support of the charges against her. The whole country was
deluged with the squalid details of this evidence, the ministers were
insulted, and the sympathy of the populace with her cause was obtrusively
displayed in every part of the kingdom. On October 3, after an adjournment
of the lords, Brougham opened the defence in the most celebrated of his
speeches. On November 2 the lord chancellor, Eldon, moved the second
reading of the bill, and on the 8th it was carried by a majority of
twenty-eight. Four days later, on the third reading, the majority had
dwindled to nine only. Knowing the temper of the house of commons,
Liverpool treated such a victory as almost equivalent to a defeat, and
announced that the government would not proceed further with the measure.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_151" id="TOPIC_151"></a>Had the queen possessed the virtue of self-respect or dignity, she would
have been satisfied with this legislative, though not morally decisive,
acquittal. But she was intoxicated with popular applause, largely due to
her royal consort's vices, and, after London had been illuminated for
three nights in her honour, she declined overtures from the government,
and appealed for a maintenance to the house of commons, which granted her
an annuity of &pound;50,000 in the next session. But she never lived to enjoy it
After going in procession to St. Paul's, to return thanks for her
deliverance, on the 29th, and vainly attempting, once more, to procure the
mention of her name in the prayer-book, she concentrated her efforts on a
claim of right to be crowned with the king. No government could have
conceded this claim, and, when it had been refused by the privy council,
her solemn protests were inevitably vain. Even her least prudent
counsellors would assuredly have dissuaded her from the attempt which she
made to force an entrance into Westminster Abbey on the coronation day,
July 19, 1821. It was a painful scene when she, who had so lately been the
idol of the fickle populace, was turned away from the doors amidst
conflicting exclamations of derision and pity. A fortnight later, on
August 2, she was officially reported to be seriously ill; on the 7th she
was no more. In accordance with her own direction her body was buried at
Brunswick. Her ill-founded popularity was shown for the last time, when a
riotous multitude succeeded in diverting her funeral procession, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
forcing it to pass through the city on its way to Harwich. But it did not
survive her long; the people were becoming tired of her, and the king, who
had forfeited the respect of the middle and upper classes, was less hated
by the lower classes after her death.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>GEORGE IV. IN IRELAND.</i></div>

<p>The personal character and opinions of George IV. seem to have influenced
politics less during the early years of his reign than during his long
regency. His coronation was celebrated with unprecedented magnificence,
and amidst external demonstrations of loyalty, hard to reconcile with the
unbounded enthusiasm which the queen had so lately inspired. Soon
afterwards, he sailed in his yacht from Portsmouth on a voyage to Ireland,
but put into Holyhead and there awaited news of the queen's expected
death. This reached him at last, and probably impressed him, no less than
his ministers, as "the greatest of all possible deliverances, both to his
majesty and the country".<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> He proceeded to Dublin in one of the
earliest steam-packets, and secluded himself until "the corpse of his wife
was supposed to have left England".<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> He then plunged into a round of
festivities, and pleased all classes of Irishmen by his affable and
condescending manners. He was, indeed, the first sovereign of England who
had appeared in Ireland on a mission of peace. John William Ward,
afterwards fourth Viscount Dudley in his letters, describes him as having
behaved like a popular candidate on an electioneering trip, and surmises
that "if the day before he left Ireland, he had stood for Dublin, he might
have turned out Shaw or Grattan ".<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> Certain it is that his visit to
Ireland was regarded as an important political event. The same kind of
success attended his visit to Scotland in August of the following year,
1822. Thenceforth, he scarcely figures in political life until the
resignation of Lord Liverpool in 1827, and though he consented with
reluctance to Canning's tenure of the foreign office, he did not attempt
to interfere with the change in foreign policy consequent upon it. He was,
in fact, sinking more and more into an apathetic voluptuary; but he could
rouse himself, and exhibit some proofs of ability, under the impulse of
his brothers, the honest Duke of York and the arch-intriguer, the Duke of
Cumberland.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span></p>

<p>The cry for retrenchment, now taken up by the country gentlemen, and not
unmingled with suggestions for a partial repudiation of the national debt,
compelled the government to adopt a policy of strict economy. Accordingly,
in 1822, Vansittart introduced a scheme for the conversion of the
so-called "Navy 5 per cents.," which resulted in a saving of above
&pound;1,000,000 annually. He also carried a more questionable scheme for the
payment of military, naval, and civil pensions, which then amounted to
&pound;4,900,000 a year, but were falling in rapidly; the money required for
this purpose was to be borrowed by trustees, and was to be repaid in the
course of forty-five years at the rate of &pound;2,800,000 a year; in this way
an immediate saving of about &pound;2,000,000 annually was effected at the cost,
however, of the next generation. By means of these expedients, with a
considerable reduction of official salaries, the government was enabled to
repeal the additional duty on malt, to diminish the duties on salt and
leather, and, on the whole to remit about &pound;3,500,000 of taxes. When the
entire credit of financial reform is given to Huskisson, Joseph Hume, and
other economists of the new school, it should not be forgotten that a
beginning was made by economists of the old school, before Huskisson
joined the government in 1823, or Robinson took Vansittart's place as
chancellor of the exchequer.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_152" id="TOPIC_152"></a>From the beginning of this reign a more enlightened spirit may be traced
in parliamentary debates. This was aided by the growth of a constitutional
movement in favour of reform in parliament as the first step towards a
redress of grievances. The movement left its first trace on the
statute-book in a measure carried by Lord John Russell in the session of
1821 for the disfranchisement of Grampound, though the vacant seats were
transferred to the county of York, instead of to the "village" of Leeds or
some other of the great unrepresented cities. This was the first instance
of the actual disfranchisement of a constituency, though it was not
without precedent that the franchise of a corrupt borough should be
extended to the freeholders of the surrounding district. A notable sign of
the progressive change was the reconstruction of the cabinet in 1822.
Liverpool, who always possessed the gift of working harmoniously with
colleagues of different views and felt the weakness of his present
ministry, once more attempted to bring about a coalition<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span> with the
Grenville party in the opposition. Grenville had long been drifting away
from his alliance with Grey, and had been a stout advocate of repressive
legislation which the more advanced whigs opposed. Though he declined
office for himself, several of his relatives and adherents were rewarded
with minor appointments, his cousin, Charles Wynn, became president of the
board of control, in succession to Bragge-Bathurst, who had himself
succeeded Canning in the previous year, and his nephew, the Marquis of
Buckingham, obtained a dukedom. Such recruits added little strength to the
Liverpool government, and Holland well said that "all articles are now to
be had at low prices, except Grenvilles".</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE DEATH OF CASTLEREAGH.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_153" id="TOPIC_153"></a>But Liverpool gained far more powerful coadjutors in the Marquis
Wellesley, Peel, and Canning. In December, 1821, Wellesley undertook the
lord-lieutenancy of Ireland, which had relapsed into so disturbed a state
that it had been proposed to make Wellington both viceroy and
commander-in-chief. The significance of this selection was increased by
the appointment of Plunket as attorney-general. Sidmouth, while retaining
his seat in the cabinet, retired, by his own wish, from the office of home
secretary, with a sense of having pacified the country, and was succeeded
by Peel. Castlereagh, now Marquis of Londonderry, remained foreign
secretary, but on August 12, 1822, as he was on the point of setting out
for the congress of Verona, he died, like Whitbread and Romilly, by his
own hand. His suicidal act was clearly due to a morbid fit of depression,
under the stress of anxieties protracted over more than twenty years; and
the disordered state of his mind had been observed, not only by
Wellington, but also by the king. His successor was Canning, who also
became leader of the house of commons.</p>

<p>The characters and political aims of these rival statesmen have often been
contrasted by historians of a later age, who have seldom done justice to
Castlereagh. It is remembered that he was the author of the Walcheren
expedition; it is forgotten that he was the advocate of sending a powerful
force to the Baltic coast at the critical moment between Jena and Eylau,
that he was not altogether responsible for the delays which rendered the
Walcheren expedition abortive or for the choice of its incompetent
commander, that his prime object was to strike a crushing blow at
Napoleon's naval power, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span> that, if his instructions had been obeyed,
this would have been effected by a rapid advance upon Antwerp when nearly
all the French troops had been withdrawn from the Netherlands. It is
remembered that he was at the war office when the operations of Wellington
in the Peninsula were crippled for want of supplies; it is forgotten that
it was he who selected Wellington, and that he loyally strained every
nerve to keep him supplied with troops, provisions, and specie, when few
but himself believed in the policy of the Peninsular war, and Sir John
Moore had assured him that if the French dominated Spain, they could not
be resisted in Portugal. It is remembered&mdash;or rather it is assumed&mdash;that
he was the eager promoter of coercive and reactionary legislation at home;
it is forgotten, or ignored, that he was among the earliest and staunchest
advocates of catholic emancipation, and that a despotic temper is belied
by the whole tone of his speeches. Above all, he is unjustly credited, in
the face of direct evidence to the contrary, with being the champion of
absolutism in the councils of Europe, the fact being not only that his
voice was always on the side of moderation and conciliation, but that
Canning himself, on succeeding him, dissociated Great Britain from the
holy alliance by taking his stand upon an admirable despatch of
Castlereagh and adopting it as his own. When he met with his tragical end,
the brutal shouts of exultation raised by a portion of the crowd at his
funeral were the expression of sheer ignorance and not of intelligent
public opinion. He was a tory, in days when most patriots were tories, but
he was a tory of the best type; and we of a later generation can see that
few statesmen of George III.'s reign have left a purer reputation or
rendered greater services to their country.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CANNING AND PEEL.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_154" id="TOPIC_154"></a>George Canning, his successor, has been far more favourably judged by
posterity, and not without reason, if intellectual brilliancy is a supreme
test of political merit. A firm adherent of Pitt, and a somewhat
unscrupulous critic of Addington, he was probably the first parliamentary
orator of the nineteenth century, with the possible exception of Sheridan.
Pitt's eloquence was of a loftier and simpler type, Fox's was more
impetuous and spontaneous; Peel's range of political knowledge was far
wider; Gladstone excelled all, not only in length of experience but in
readiness and dialectical resource. Canning's rhetoric was of a finer
quality and was combined with great debating power,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span> but he was a man to
inspire admiration rather than confidence, and had not held one of the
higher political offices since his resignation in 1809, after his quarrel
with Castlereagh. He accepted a mission to Portugal, however, and was in
Lisbon when Napoleon returned from Elba. In 1816, as has been seen, he
became president of the board of control, but, having been formerly one of
the queen's advisers, he declined to have anything to do with her trial
and remained abroad during its continuance. In December, 1820, he
returned, but persisted in resigning his place at the board of control on
the supposed ground that further parliamentary discussion of the queen's
case was inevitable. On this occasion he received a special vote of thanks
from the directors of the East India Company for his services on the
board. The king objected to his readmission after the queen's death, and
he was a private member of parliament when he was offered and undertook
the governor-generalship of India in March, 1822. But his departure was
delayed until August, and he was on his way to bid farewell to his
constituents at Liverpool when Castlereagh destroyed himself. It was
generally felt that no other man was so well qualified as Canning to
succeed him. But the king declared his "final and unalterable decision" to
sanction no such change. Though he afterwards relented, on the
remonstrances of Wellington, he did so with a bad grace; but there was no
delay on Canning's part in accepting the foreign secretaryship thus
offered. From his acceptance may be dated the most remarkable part of his
career.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_155" id="TOPIC_155"></a>The accession of Peel to the Liverpool ministry, in the capacity of home
secretary; was only less important than that of Canning. Hitherto, Peel
had mostly been known to the British public as chief secretary for
Ireland, and as chairman of the committee which, in 1819, recommended the
early resumption of cash payments. In both these posts he displayed a
certain moderation and independence of mind, combined with a rare capacity
for business, which marked him out as a great administrator. This promise
he amply fulfilled as home secretary. He was the first minister of the
crown who took up the philanthropic work of Romilly and Mackintosh,
largely reducing the number of offences for which capital punishment could
be inflicted. He was also the first to reform the police<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span> system of
London, and to substitute for a multitude of decrepit watchmen, incapable
of dealing with gangs of active criminals, a disciplined body of stalwart
constables, which has since been copied in every county and large town of
Great Britain. Above all, while he cannot be said to have shown a
statesmanlike insight or foresight of the highest order, he could read the
signs of the times and the temper of his countrymen with a sagacity far
beyond that of his predecessor, Sidmouth, or of such politicians as Eldon
and Castlereagh. In him was represented the domestic policy of Pitt in his
earlier days, as Pitt's financial views were represented in Huskisson, who
had actually served under him.</p>

<p>Though Huskisson was only made president of the board of trade, in
January, 1823, and not chancellor of the exchequer, it is certain that his
mind controlled that of Robinson, who succeeded Vansittart in that
position. Vansittart, who was created Lord Bexley, succeeded
Bragge-Bathurst as chancellor of the duchy. The cabinet changes were
completed in October by the removal of Wellesley Pole, now Lord
Maryborough, from the office of master of the mint. Huskisson, if any man,
was the leading pioneer of free trade, and there can be little doubt that,
had he not died prematurely, its adoption would have been hastened by ten
or fifteen years. In his first year of office he welcomed petitions for
the repeal of the import duties on foreign wool, but failed to convince
the wool manufacturers that it must be accompanied by the abolition of
export duties on British wool. The proposed reform was, therefore,
dropped, and a like fate befell his attempt in the same year to benefit
the silk trade by abolishing certain vexatious restrictions upon it,
including the practice of fixing the wages of Spitalfields weavers by an
order of the magistrates. For the moment the ignorant outcry of the
journeymen themselves prevailed over their real interests, but in the
following year, 1824, Huskisson carried a much wider measure, providing
that foreign silks, hitherto excluded, should be admitted subject to a
duty of 30 per cent. in and after 1826, and another measure for the joint
relief of wool growers and wool manufacturers which imposed a small duty
of equal amount on the importation and the exportation of wool.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_156" id="TOPIC_156"></a>His great achievement in 1823 was the reform of the navi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>gation laws.
These acts, dating from the commonwealth and the restoration, gave British
shipowners a qualified monopoly of the carrying trade, since they
prohibited the importation of European goods except in British ships or
ships of the producing country, while the importation of goods from other
quarters of the world was confined to British ships only. America had
protested against this exclusive system, and it was abandoned, as regards
the United States, by the treaty of Ghent in 1814. The mercantile states
of Europe soon followed the example of America, and the reciprocity of
duties bill, introduced by Huskisson on June 6, 1823, conceded equal
rights to all countries reciprocating the concession, only retaining the
exclusion against such countries as might reject equality of trade. The
change involved some hardship to shipowners who had built their vessels
with timber bought at prices raised by heavy duties, but they were too
shortsighted to accept the compromise offered by Huskisson. Before long,
however, the act was justified, and the shipowners compensated by a rapid
increase in British shipping.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>AGRICULTURAL DISCONTENT.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_157" id="TOPIC_157"></a>For nearly five years after the accession of George IV. the state of the
country was, on the whole, more prosperous, and the industrial classes
were more contented, than in the five years next preceding. Such
restlessness as there was prevailed among farmers and agricultural
labourers rather than among workmen in the manufacturing districts, and in
1823 every branch of manufactures was reported to be flourishing. It is
difficult for a later generation, accustomed to consider 30s. a quarter a
fair price for wheat, to understand the perennial complaints and petitions
of the agricultural interest when 60s. a quarter was regarded as a low
price for wheat, and the cultivation of wheat extended over a vastly
larger area than it does at present. Nor is the difficulty lessened, when
we remember the miserably low rate of wages then paid by farmers. A
partial explanation may be found in the fact that what they saved in wages
they lost in poor rates, and that most agricultural products except corn
were sold at a very small profit. The high poor rates were the result of
the disastrous system of giving allowances to labourers.</p>

<p>But there were other evils caused by the vicious policy pursued by the
government. The encouragement of home production had led to the enclosure
of land not fit for cultivation, so that a slight fall in prices meant
ruin to many farmers. Moreover, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span> corn laws, though framed for the
purpose of arresting fluctuations in price, actually increased
fluctuations and thus enhanced the risks attending agricultural
enterprise. Nor were landlords who had thriven on war prices, and raised
the scale of their establishments as if these prices were to be perpetual,
willing to reduce their rents on the return of peace. Rent was said to
have risen 70 per cent. since 1792; but the landlords were often
embarrassed, because their lands had too often been burdened with
jointures, settlements, and mortgages during the war. It was in their
interest that the act of 1815, which aimed at maintaining war prices, had
been passed. But the deeper reason for all this clamour from the rural
districts was the stagnation of ideas, and incapacity of improvement,
engendered by an artificial monopoly of the national food supply. This was
not the special lesson impressed upon landlords or tenants by Cobbett,
whose violent and delusive writings had a large circulation in the
country. But his teaching was so far beneficial that it quickened the
demand for parliamentary reform, though the fruits of that reform were
destined to be very different from the expectations which he excited.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>SPECULATIVE FRENZY.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_158" id="TOPIC_158"></a>The spell of general prosperity which, in spite of some distress in the
rural districts, prevailed in the years 1820-23 was somewhat broken in
1824 by strikes and outrages in the manufacturing districts. Strikes for
higher wages naturally arose out of the increase in mill owners' profits,
and the ferocious spirit displayed by the strikers against masters and
fellow-workmen was attributed by reformers to the one-sided operation of
the combination laws. Accordingly, a committee of the house of commons
reported in favour of repealing these laws, and also part of the common
law which treated coercion either by trade unions or by masters as
conspiracy. A bill founded on this report was hastily passed, with the
natural result that strikes broke out in every quarter of the country;
wholesale and cruel oppression was practised by trade unionists, and it
became necessary for parliament to retrace its steps. Under a new act,
passed in 1825, which continued in force until very recent times, trade
unions were recognised as legal, but their worst malpractices were once
more brought within the control of the criminal law.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> So far the
commercial policy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span> of Huskisson was justified, as a whole, by its effects
on trade, and the session of 1824 was closed on June 25 by a cheerful
speech from the king, in which the disturbed state of Ireland was the only
topic suggestive of anxiety. Already, however, the revival of commercial
hopefulness at home, with the opening of new markets in South America, was
paving the way for the most ruinous mania of speculation known in England
since the south sea bubble. It was well that sound and sober-minded
economists now guided the action of the government, and that Liverpool
proved himself a worthy successor of Sir Robert Walpole during the great
financial crisis of 1825.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<p>The speculative frenzy of 1825 differed from the railway mania of the next
generation in that it had no solid basis of remunerative investment. The
development of the railway system, after the application of locomotive
steam engines to iron tramways, offered a legitimate promise of large
profits, and this promise would have been still more amply realised but
for the shameful waste of capital on competition and law expenses. It was
otherwise with the dupes and victims of the rage for speculation which
possessed all classes of society in 1825, and arose out of an immense
accumulation of wealth for which no safe employment could be found at home
except at a modest rate of interest. The weakening of the hold of Spain on
South America left her colonies open to foreign trade, but the enterprises
there and elsewhere which absorbed the hard-won savings of humble
families, by thousands and tens of thousands, were nearly all chimerical,
and some of them grotesque in their absurdity. Whether or not warming-pans
and skates were actually exported to the tropics, it is certain that
Scotch dairy-women emigrated to Buenos Ayres for the purpose of milking
wild cows and churning butter for people who preferred oil. The incredible
multiplication of bubble-companies was facilitated by a marvellous
cheapness of money, largely due to an inordinate issue of notes by country
bankers, and even by the Bank of England, in spite of the fact that gold
and silver were known to be leaving the country in vast quantities,
especially in the shape of loans to France. The inevitable reaction came
when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span> the Bank of England contracted its issue of notes in order to arrest
the drain of gold; goods recklessly bought up had to be sold at a fearful
loss, bills upon which advances had been made proved to be of no value,
and several great London banking houses stopped payment, bringing down in
their fall a much larger number of country banks dependent on them.</p>

<p>In the month of December, 1825, the crisis was at its height, and it is
stated that within six or seven weeks after the failure of the banking
firm of Pole &amp; Company on the 5th, sixty or seventy banks had broken. The
king's speech in July had congratulated parliament on increasing
prosperity and had betrayed no misgivings about its stability. When the
crash came, however, the ministers showed no want of firmness or resource.
They could not repair the consequences of national folly, but they devoted
themselves with intelligence to a restoration of credit. For this purpose
they suppressed at once the further issue of small notes from country
banks by a high-handed act of authority, for which they admitted that an
act of indemnity might be needed. At the same time they rapidly increased
the supply of small notes from the Bank of England, and of coin from the
mint. Moreover, they induced the Bank of England to establish branches in
a few provincial towns and to make advances upon merchants' goods to the
amount of three millions. It cost a greater effort to break down the
monopoly of the Bank of England by legalising joint-stock banks in the
provinces, though not within a distance of sixty-five miles from London.
Such practical expedients as these, seconded by the good sense of the
mercantile community, proved sufficient to avert a catastrophe only less
disastrous than national bankruptcy. With the subsidence of alarm, the
causes of alarm also subsided, the recuperative powers of the country
reasserted themselves, as during the great war, and the heart-breaking
anxieties of 1825-26 were ignored, if not forgotten, in the political
excitement of 1827.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>ECONOMIC REFORM.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_159" id="TOPIC_159"></a>The budgets of 1823-26 indeed mark a memorable advance in financial
reform, which the commercial panic of 1825 scarcely interrupted. There had
been a reduction of the national debt by about &pound;25,000,000. "The poorer
householders had been relieved from the pressure both of house tax and
window tax.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span> The manufacturing classes had been encouraged by the
reduction of the duties on silk, wool, and iron. The consuming classes had
been benefited by the reduction of duties on spirits, wines, coffee, and
sugar."<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> Owing to Huskisson's enlightened policy the old navigation
laws had been repealed upon the condition of reciprocity; the combination
laws had been liberally revised; various bounties had been abandoned on
free trade principles, and the monstrous evils of smuggling had been
greatly abated. If the chancellor of the exchequer could show no surplus
in 1826, he could at least boast that after so desperate a crisis there
was no deficit, and he had no reason to be ashamed of Cobbett's nickname,
"Prosperity Robinson," which he owed to his optimism, largely founded upon
facts. Before the close of the year 1826, however, this optimism received
a rude shock. The agitation against the corn laws assumed an acuter form
than ever, and Huskisson prudently deprecated it on the simple ground that
no effective action could be taken in an expiring parliament. Distress had
recurred in the manufacturing districts; mills and power-looms were again
destroyed. The free trade policy of Huskisson was vigorously attacked in
parliament, but it was successfully defended in powerful speeches by
Canning as well as by himself. Ultimately the government, having obtained
limited powers from parliament to admit foreign corn during the temporary
emergency, had the courage to exceed those powers and seek an indemnity
from the next parliament.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_160" id="TOPIC_160"></a>The dissolution of 1826, closing the life of one of the longest
parliaments in modern times, was the prelude to a very eventful year. The
general election brought into prominence the two burning questions of
catholic relief and the corn laws, and unseated for the moment Brougham,
Cobbett, Hunt, and Lord John Russell, but it produced no material change
in the balance of parties. Little was done in the short autumn session,
but when parliament met again early in February, 1827, great events had
already cast their shadows before. The Duke of York, heir-presumptive to
the crown, had died on January 5. He was known to be a strong tory in
politics, but, in spite of this, and of the scandals which attached to his
name in earlier years, he enjoyed a considerable share of popular
confidence. Compared<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span> with his elder brother, he was respected; he was a
true Englishman, like his father, whom he resembled in character; his
administration of the army had survived hostile criticism, while a
declaration which he had recently made against catholic emancipation had
produced a profound impression on public opinion. Much less was known of
the Duke of Clarence, who stood next in succession. He had already injured
himself in public estimation by declining the increased allowance offered
him, and then claiming it with arrears; nor did he now improve his
position in the eyes of his future subjects by stickling for a larger
addition to it than parliament was disposed to grant. But the Duke of
York's death was followed by a far more important incident. Liverpool was
disabled by illness from attending his funeral, which, occurring in the
depth of winter, proved directly fatal to one of those who were present,
and seriously weakened the constitutions of others, including Canning. On
February 8, the first day of the session, Liverpool was in his place,
though in broken health, and on the 17th he took a feeble part in the
debate on the grant to the Duke of Clarence. On the following morning he
was struck down by a paralytic seizure, and, though his life was prolonged
for two years, he never recovered the use of his faculties.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE CLOSE OF LIVERPOOL'S MINISTRY.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_161" id="TOPIC_161"></a>Liverpool's disappearance from the political scenes may be said to mark an
epoch in the later history of England. Though only fifty-six years of age,
he had been continuously in office for twenty years, and prime minister
for fifteen, a tenure of power which none of his predecessors had exceeded
except Walpole and Pitt. His lot was cast in the most critical period of
the great war, and in the long night of adversity and anxiety which
ushered in the "thirty years' peace". As foreign secretary he conducted
the negotiations for the peace of Amiens; as home secretary he led the
house of lords and was responsible for the government of Ireland; as
secretary for war and the colonies he gave Wellington a steady, if not
ardent, support in those apparently barren campaigns which strained the
national patience; as prime minister he guided the ship of state in all
the difficulties of foreign and domestic affairs which arose between 1812
and 1827. Castlereagh may have been the most influential minister in the
earlier years of his administration, and Canning in the later, but he was
never the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span> mere tool of either; on the contrary, it Is certain that he was
treated with respect and deference by all his numerous colleagues. In
general capacity and debating power he was inferior to few of them; in
temper, judgment, and experience he was superior to all.</p>

<p>He may be said to have lived and died without "a policy," in so far as he
forebore to identify himself with any of the great questions then pressing
for solution. His real policy both at home and abroad was one of
moderation and conciliation; he looked at party divisions almost with the
eyes of a permanent official who can work loyally with chiefs of either
party; and he succeeded in keeping together in his cabinet ambitious
rivals who never would have co-operated under any other leader. This is
not the road to fame, neither is it the course which men of imperious
character like Castlereagh, or Canning, or Wellington, in his place, would
have adopted. But Canning and Wellington actually proved themselves
incapable of winning the confidence which Liverpool so long retained, and
the whig government which followed them fell to pieces in two years.
Moderation in statesmanship does not always imply mediocrity of ability;
and if Liverpool failed to see how many institutions needed radical
amendment, he was not so blind as some of his more celebrated associates.
Not only was he more liberal in his views than Eldon and Castlereagh, but
he was less opposed to free trade than most of his cabinet, to
parliamentary reform than Canning, and to catholic emancipation than
Wellington or Peel. His fault was that he did not act upon his own inward
convictions with sufficient promptitude, or assert his own authority with
sufficient energy. Had he done so, the beneficial measures of the last
years of his administration might have been anticipated, and the country
might have been spared much of the misery which darkened the close of
George III.'s reign.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<h3>PROBLEMS IN SOUTHERN EUROPE.</h3>


<p><a name="TOPIC_162" id="TOPIC_162"></a>The events of the year 1820 subjected the European concert to a severe
strain. An insurrection broke out in Spain on January 1, and on March 9
the king was forced to swear fidelity to the obsolete constitution of
1812. The result was to plunge the country into disorder, as both the
clerical party and the extreme revolutionists refused to accept the
constitution. Meanwhile the assassination by a working man of the Duke of
Berry, who died on February 14, 1820, had occasioned a new royalist
reaction in France, and had increased the general fear of the
revolutionary party. The Bourbon succession had seemed to depend on his
life, for his son, the Count of Chambord, was posthumous. On receiving the
news of the Spanish revolution the tsar, already tiring of his liberal
enthusiasm, fell back on his scheme for exercising paternal discipline
over Europe. He proposed in April that the ambassadors at Paris should
issue a joint remonstrance requiring the Spanish cortes to disavow the
revolution, and to enact severe laws against sedition. Failing this, he
proposed joint intervention, and offered for his own part to send an army
of 15,000 men through North Italy and southern France to co-operate in the
suppression of the revolution. To this Castlereagh replied that England
would never consent to a joint intervention in Spain. Metternich was too
much displeased with the Russian encouragement of secret societies in
Italy to wish to see Russian troops in that country, and both Castlereagh
and Metternich wished to keep Spain free from French influence. In the
face of this opposition Russia could not, and France would not, do
anything, and all thought of intervention was postponed. It was the last
time that Castlereagh was able to assert the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span> principle of
non-intervention without breaking up the European concert.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>REVOLUTIONS IN SOUTHERN EUROPE.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_163" id="TOPIC_163"></a>July and August saw three new revolutions. A rebellion at Nola on July 2
ended in King Ferdinand of the Two Sicilies taking the oath on the 13th to
the Spanish constitution, then regarded as a model by the liberals of
Southern Europe. But the grant of a constitution to Naples suggested a
demand for independence at Palermo. On July 17-18 that city rose in revolt
and was only subdued by the Neapolitans in the beginning of October.
Portugal, too, was in a disturbed state. The royal family had been absent
for nearly thirteen years, and the country had for five years been
governed by Lord, afterwards Viscount, Beresford as marshal and commander
of the Portuguese army. In April, 1820, he sailed for Brazil, intending to
induce the king, John VI., to return. During his absence a revolution took
place at Oporto on August 24, a provisional government was established,
and all British officers were dismissed. This was followed by a similar
revolution at Lisbon on September 15. Beresford on his return was
forbidden to land, and retired to England. On November 11, the Spanish
constitution was proclaimed in Portugal, but six days later another
proclamation left the question of determining the constitution to the
cortes which were to be elected on a popular suffrage.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_164" id="TOPIC_164"></a>The Neapolitan revolution raised at once the question of intervention. In
this case Castlereagh held that Austria had a right to interfere, because
her position as an Italian power was endangered by the revolution, and
because the revolution was a breach of the secret treaty of 1815 which had
received the sanction of the British government. He still objected to any
joint interference and was opposed to the reference of the question to a
congress. Austria could not have interfered alone without offending the
tsar, who clung to the principle of joint action. The question of
intervention was therefore postponed for the present. France, however,
being jealous of Austrian influence in Italy, demanded the meeting of a
congress, and such a meeting was accordingly held at Troppau on October
20. To this congress Austria, France, Prussia, and Russia sent
plenipotentiaries. Great Britain carried her opposition to joint
interference so far as to refuse to join in the deliberations, though<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span> Sir
Charles, now Lord, Stewart was sent to Troppau to watch the proceedings.
Metternich, on finding that he could not avoid the meeting of a congress,
determined to lead its proceedings, and, before it met, drew up a
memorandum defining his own views about intervention. These views were
accepted at the congress by Prussia and Russia as well as by Austria; and
a protocol was issued by the three powers declaring that a state in which
a revolution should occur was dangerous to other states, and ceased to be
a member of the European alliance, until it could give guarantees for its
future stability. If such a revolution placed other states in immediate
danger, the allied powers were bound to intervene by peaceful means, if
possible, or if need were, by arms. Before parting, the congress invited
Ferdinand of the Two Sicilies to attend an adjourned meeting, to assemble
early in the following year at Laibach.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> Against these decisions
Castlereagh protested in vigorous terms, and more especially against any
possible application of the principle of intervention to England; France
under the Duke of Richelieu joined in neither the protocol nor the
protest. The liberal tendencies of the tsar had been quenched by recent
events, so that, instead of a concert of Europe, there was left only a
concert of absolute monarchs.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>AUSTRIAN INTERVENTION.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_165" id="TOPIC_165"></a>In January, 1821, the sovereigns of Austria, Prussia, and Russia met the
King of the Two Sicilies at Laibach. France had vainly attempted to
mediate between the King of the Two Sicilies and his people. But the
Neapolitans were not satisfied with any vague promise of a constitution,
and before allowing their king to depart for Laibach, held him pledged to
the observance of an impossible condition, the maintenance of the Spanish
constitution of 1812. The king's oath to preserve this particularly
objectionable constitution was regarded by Austria as sufficient to
preclude negotiation, and it was resolved that she should restore him by
force as an absolute monarch, and should occupy the Neapolitan territory.
The duration of this occupation was reserved as a question to be discussed
at the next European congress, which it was intended to hold at Florence
in the autumn of the next year. After a show of resistance at Rieti the
Neapolitans submitted, and the Austrian<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span> army entered Naples on March 24.
The restoration of absolute government was accompanied by severities
towards the constitutionalists, but Austria would not allow any repetition
of the bloodshed of 1799.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_166" id="TOPIC_166"></a>While the Austrian army was marching southwards, a new revolution broke
out in Piedmont. The Spanish constitution was proclaimed at Alessandria on
March 10, and at Turin on the 12th. On the 13th, Victor Emmanuel I., King
of Sardinia, abdicated, appointing as regent his distant cousin Prince
Charles Albert of Carignano, who had been in communication with the
revolutionary party. The regent immediately accepted the Spanish
constitution on condition of the maintenance of the line of succession and
of the Roman catholic religion. The new king, Charles Felix, was at Modena
when the revolt occurred. He refused to acknowledge the new constitution,
and ordered Charles Albert to betake himself to Novara, where the royalist
troops were collecting. On the night of the 21st, Charles Albert fled from
Turin to Novara, but the constitutional party did not submit without a
struggle. On April 8 the Austrians crossed the frontier and, uniting with
the royalists, defeated the constitutionalists at Novara. Two days later
the royalist army entered Turin. The two Italian revolutions had thus
ended in an Austrian occupation of the two largest Italian states which
were not ruled by members of the imperial house. The Papal States were now
the only Italian principality of any size which was not dominated by
Austria.</p>

<p>So far Austria had been sufficiently powerful in the congresses of the
powers to be able to prevent interference with other states where it was
not to her interest, and to incline the balance in favour of it where
intervention would strengthen her. The reopening of the Eastern question
made her ascendency more difficult to maintain. The congress of Laibach
had been closed, but the sovereigns had not yet departed, when the news
arrived that a revolt, engineered by Greeks with the pretence of Russian
support, had broken out against the Turks in Moldavia and Wallachia.
Russia at once agreed with Austria that the principle laid down at Troppau
applied to this revolt; the insurrectionary leaders were disowned by
Russia, and by the end of June Turkish authority was restored in the
Danubian principalities. So far the action of Russia had met with the
approval<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span> not only of Austria but of Great Britain, and Castlereagh had
written to Alexander urging him not to join the Greek cause, which
appeared to him to be part of an universal revolutionary movement.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_167" id="TOPIC_167"></a>Early in April, however, a more serious insurrection broke out in the
Morea, and was followed a few weeks later by one in Central Greece. The
war was disgraced from the first by inhuman massacres on both sides. The
Greek patriarch at Constantinople together with three archbishops was
executed by the Turks on Easter Sunday, April 22. A great ferment in
Russia was the result, where the people were anxious to assist their
co-religionists and to avenge the death of the patriarch, whom they
regarded as a martyr. The grievances of the Orthodox religion were
seconded by the proper grievances of Russia. Greek ships, sailing under
the Russian flag, had been seized in the Dardanelles; the principalities
of Moldavia and Wallachia had not been evacuated by the Turkish troops as
was required by treaty, while an ancient treaty rendered it possible to
regard the wrongs of the Greek Church as the political wrongs of Russia. A
Russian ultimatum was despatched on June 28; and, while awaiting a reply,
Russia consulted the other powers as to the course they would pursue in
the event of war breaking out between Russia and Turkey, and the system
with which they would propose to replace the Turkish domination if it came
to be destroyed. The principle of joint intervention, adopted at Troppau,
seemed to require the powers to give their support to Russia. Great
Britain and Austria, however, refused to treat war with Turkey as a
possibility. The Greek revolt seemed to them to express the principle of
revolution, and the tsar himself became inclined to take this view of the
situation when the Greeks established an advanced republican form of
government. They accordingly distinguished between the treaty rights of
Russia, which the four powers would urge Turkey to respect, and the
provision of a more secure state of order in Turkey, which would be
discussed at a European congress. The Russian ambassador had been
withdrawn from Constantinople on August 8, and the negotiation was
conducted mainly by Lord Strangford, the British ambassador at
Constantinople, who was supported by Austria, France, and Prussia. He
succeeded in inducing Turkey to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span> evacuate the principalities and to open
the Dardanelles to ships of all nations, but Turkish obstinacy deferred
the conclusion of a treaty.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE SPANISH QUESTION.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_168" id="TOPIC_168"></a>Meanwhile the Spanish question became more critical. As time went on Spain
grew less instead of more settled, while the ultra-royalist party gained
strength in France. To them the position to which the Bourbon King of
Spain had been reduced seemed at once an insult and a menace to France.
The establishment of Austrian supremacy in Italy made them long for French
supremacy in Spain. In August, 1821, the presence of yellow fever in Spain
was made the occasion for establishing a body of troops, professing to act
as a sanitary cordon, upon the frontier. They were retained there when the
fever had disappeared, and their numbers were gradually raised to 100,000.
<a name="TOPIC_169" id="TOPIC_169"></a>In December, 1821, an ultra-royalist ministry entered on office in France
under the leadership of Vill&egrave;le. Vill&egrave;le, like King Louis XVIII., was
opposed to war, but he might easily be forced to adopt the war policy
which was popular with his party. Fresh evidence was given of the
contagious nature of the Spanish revolution by the adoption, on the 27th
of the preceding June, by the Portuguese cortes, of a constitution
modelled on that of Spain. Six days later the Portuguese king arrived at
Lisbon and was induced to sign the new constitution. This event was the
more significant in the eyes of the powers, because the proclamation of
the constitution had been accompanied by an insult to the Austrian
embassy.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_170" id="TOPIC_170"></a>If Spanish liberalism placed Spain in danger of a war with France, Spain
was in equal danger of a war with Great Britain because she was not
liberal enough. The revolution of 1820, instead of reconciling the
revolted colonies, had served as an example to the loyal colonies to seek
their liberty. By the summer of 1822 Upper Peru was the only part of the
American mainland where Spain held more than isolated posts; she had been
compelled to sell Florida to the United States, and San Domingo had joined
the revolted French colony of Hayti. The Spanish cortes, however, were
even more resolute than the king had been to maintain the authority of the
mother country, and protested against the right which the British had
claimed and exercised of trading with the revolted colonies. The
disorderly state of these colonies encouraged the growth of piracy, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
flourished even in the ports which still acknowledged the supremacy of
Spain. Special irritation was caused in 1822 by the condemnation of the
<i>Lord Collingwood</i> for trading with Buenos Ayres, a place over which Spain
had exercised no authority for twelve years. In the same year the new
navigation acts greatly increased the facilities for trading with Great
Britain enjoyed by such places in America as admitted British ships. In
April, 1822, the United States recognised the independence of Colombia,
but Great Britain refrained as yet from recognising any of the
Spanish-American states, partly because of their unsettled condition and
partly because the threat of recognition was a valuable diplomatic counter
in negotiations with Spain.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_171" id="TOPIC_171"></a>Instead of a congress being held at Florence it was finally determined
that the Italian questions should be referred to a congress which was to
meet at Verona in September, 1822, and was to be preceded by a conference
at Vienna on the Eastern question; there could, however, be little doubt
that the Spanish question would also be raised. Castlereagh, or as we
should now call him Lord Londonderry, would have preferred that Great
Britain should stand aloof from the Spanish and Italian questions, but he
desired that she should participate in the discussion of the Eastern
question; it was accordingly arranged that he should represent Great
Britain at the conference of Vienna, and he had actually drawn up
instructions in favour of non-intervention in Spain and of accrediting
agents to some of the South American republics, when his departure was
prevented by his death on August 12. He was succeeded by Wellington as
plenipotentiary, and by Canning as foreign secretary. The change was,
however, one of persons rather than of policies. Canning was less
conciliatory in manner, and had less sympathy with the principle of
European congresses, but was prepared to carry on Castlereagh's policy on
the questions which for the time being agitated the world.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE CONGRESS OF VERONA.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_172" id="TOPIC_172"></a>The Spanish question was, as a fact, the one question which occupied the
attention of the powers at Vienna and Verona. In consequence of the
efforts of Strangford at Constantinople and his own growing
dissatisfaction with the Greeks, the tsar was willing to allow the Greek
question to drop; at the same time the kings of the Two Sicilies and
Sardinia themselves desired the continuance of Austrian occupation, and
thus post<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>poned the Italian question. As in 1820, Austria held the balance
between two rival policies. She had then thrown her weight on the side of
non-intervention, and, had the Spanish question stood by itself, she would
probably have done so again. But in Metternich's opinion the Spanish
question was of less importance than the Eastern, and it was important
that the tsar should not doubt her loyalty to the principle on which she
had persuaded him to refrain from an attack upon the Porte.</p>

<p>On passing through Paris on his way to Vienna, Wellington found Vill&egrave;le
desirous of avoiding war, but counting on it as a probability. He arrived
at Vienna too late for the actual conference, but in time to have some
conversation with Metternich and the tsar before leaving for Verona. So
far it appeared that Montmorency, the more active of the French
representatives, though professing to desire a peaceful termination to the
dispute between France and Spain, advocated French intervention, if
intervention should be necessary, but was opposed to the passage of
foreign troops through France. Metternich and the tsar distrusted French
troops when brought face to face with revolutionists, and Metternich was
therefore opposed to intervention, while the tsar still desired to be
allowed to march a Russian army on behalf of the combined powers through
Piedmont and southern France into Spain. Metternich of course did not wish
to see any Russian troops to dispute Austria's supremacy in Italy. But all
three desired the suppression of the Spanish constitution, if they could
find a trustworthy instrument. Wellington adhered to Castlereagh's policy
of non-intervention.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_173" id="TOPIC_173"></a>When the congress opened at Verona on October 20, Montmorency proposed
three skilfully drawn questions. Avoiding the direct discussion of
hostilities, he asked whether, if France were compelled to withdraw her
ambassador from Madrid, the other powers would do the same. Then, assuming
their sympathy, he asked what form of moral support they would give her in
event of war. Lastly, he propitiated Russian views of joint action by
asking what form of material support the powers would give France, if she
should require it. Wellington refused to consider hypothetical cases, but
the sovereigns of Austria,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span> Prussia, and Russia answered the first
question in the affirmative, and assured France of their moral, and, if
necessary, of their material support. So far no power had abandoned its
original attitude, but the promises had been given in a form which lent
itself best to the sole interference of France, as the representative of
the congress. Metternich now advocated British mediation, but this was
refused by Montmorency on the ground of the differences between the policy
adopted by Great Britain and that adopted by the other powers. It was then
agreed that Austria, France, Prussia, and Russia should address notes of
the same tenor to their ambassadors at Madrid, who should make
corresponding representations to the Spanish government, and a <i>proc&egrave;s
verbal</i> was concluded between these four powers defining the causes which
would justify the recall of their ambassadors.</p>

<p>As the French king was not present at Verona, the sending of the French
note was made conditional on the approval of the French government. The
occupation of Spain by foreign troops was to be discussed when the King of
Spain should have been restored to liberty. The tenor of the notes agreed
on seemed to Wellington more likely to inflame the Spanish government than
to win concessions, and he lost no time in informing Vill&egrave;le through Sir
Charles Stuart, the British ambassador at Paris, of the course of
negotiations.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> Although Wellington had been assured at Verona that
Vill&egrave;le's decision would not affect the transmission of notes from the
other courts, he hoped and Canning believed that it was still in the power
of Vill&egrave;le to arrest the machinery that Montmorency, his representative at
Verona, had set in motion. On November 30 Wellington left Verona, but the
emperors remained. On December 5 Vill&egrave;le sent a message to Verona
proposing to postpone sending the despatches till an occasion for breaking
off diplomatic relations as defined in the <i>proc&egrave;s verbal</i> should arise,
and suggesting that the ambassadors at Paris should determine when such an
occasion had occurred. This proposal was rejected. It was inconsistent
with Russia's desire for war, while Austria was anxious to please Russia
in the west, so long as she remained pacific in the east. The three
eastern powers therefore resolved that they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span> would only delay sending
their notes till the French note was ready.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE SPANISH QUESTION.</i></div>

<p>While this negotiation was pending, Wellington arrived at Paris, where,
under strong pressure from Canning,<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> he renewed his offer of mediation
with Spain. It was declined. On the arrival of the reply from Verona,
Wellington was informed that even if the other powers sent their
despatches to Madrid, France would withhold hers. In the end, Vill&egrave;le
dismissed Montmorency for the independent line he had taken, and sent a
milder note than the three eastern powers, but withdrew his ambassador
from Madrid soon after the other ambassadors had departed. Great Britain
was in consequence the only great power which still continued diplomatic
relations with Spain at the end of January, 1823. In the course of the
negotiations two curious suspicions had occurred to Canning and Vill&egrave;le
respectively. Canning imagined that France would employ the threats of her
allies as a show of force to compel Spain to join her in an attack on
British commerce in the West Indies, while Vill&egrave;le suspected that the
British defence of the political independence of Spain was to be
recompensed by the cession of some Spanish colonies in America.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_174" id="TOPIC_174"></a>Meanwhile, the war party before which Vill&egrave;le had had to bow, was having
its own way in France. On January 28 Louis XVIII. in opening the chambers
announced the withdrawal of his ambassador, and declared that 100,000
Frenchmen were ready to march to preserve the throne of Spain to a
descendant of Henry IV., and to reconcile that country with Europe. The
sole object of any war that might arise would be to render Ferdinand VII.
free to give his people institutions which they could not hold except from
him, and which, by securing their tranquillity, would dissipate the unrest
in France. Canning protested against the apparent implication that no
valid constitution could rest on any other basis than that of France did,
as also against the apparent claim to interfere in virtue of the family
relation of the dynasties of France and Spain; but he vainly endeavoured
to persuade the Spanish government to come to some agreement with its
king. On March 31, when war seemed imminent, Canning despatched a note to
Paris defining the limits of British<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span> neutrality. The independence of
Spain and integrity of its dominions were to be recognised; it was not to
be permanently occupied by a military force, and France was not to attempt
to gain either by conquest or by cession any of the revolted colonies of
Spain in America. At the same time he disclaimed any intention of
acquiring any of those colonies for Great Britain.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>PORTUGAL AND BRAZIL.</i></div>

<p>War between France and Spain began with the passage of the frontier by the
Duke of Angoul&ecirc;me on April 7. On May 23 he entered Madrid. On October 1
the Spanish constitutionalists were compelled to set their king at liberty
to join the French, and on November 1 the war was terminated by the
surrender of Barcelona to the royalists. The restoration of Ferdinand VII.
to absolute power was followed by a furious and vindictive reaction, which
Angoul&ecirc;me strove in vain to moderate. For the next five years French
troops occupied the country, but Angoul&ecirc;me showed his disapproval of the
method of government by refusing the decorations offered him by Ferdinand.
The restoration of absolutism in Spain led to events in Portugal which
forced Great Britain to intervene and strengthened the difference between
her policy and that of the continental powers. The new Portuguese
constitution was unpopular, especially in the army, and as early as
February, 1823, there was a revolt against the constitution, but order was
restored in April. On May 26 another absolutist revolt broke out, and the
rebels were joined next day by the king's second son, Dom Miguel, then
twenty years of age; on the 29th the revolt spread to Lisbon; on the 31st
the king promised a revised constitution, and on June 2 the cortes ceased
to sit. The government resolved itself into an absolute monarchy, which
continued till the following year, in spite of the appointment of a junta
under the presidency of Palmella to draw up a new constitution. The
ambassadors of Austria, Prussia, and Russia opposed the granting of a new
constitution, and Dom Miguel still maintained a threatening attitude.
Palmella accordingly applied to Great Britain for troops to support his
government. This request created no little difficulty. It was impossible
for Great Britain to allow the government of Portugal to fall into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span> the
hands of a party resting for support on the absolutists in Spain and the
French army, and it was equally impossible to employ British troops to
maintain the cause of the King of Portugal against his ultra-royalist
subjects when Great Britain had protested so vigorously against the kings
of Spain and the Two Sicilies receiving foreign assistance against their
liberal subjects; there were moreover no troops that could well be spared.</p>

<p>Canning accordingly contented himself with despatching a naval squadron to
the Tagus to act as a moral support to the king. As the event proved, this
squadron was sufficient to determine the course of events. At the same
time Canning refused to guarantee any constitution, though when France
joined the eastern powers in threatening the proposed constitution, he
intimated his readiness to resist by force of arms any foreign
intervention in Portugal. On April 30, 1824, Dom Miguel attempted another
<i>coup d'&eacute;tat</i>, and was for nine days in possession of Lisbon, where he
made wholesale arrests of his political opponents. John VI. was, however,
supported by all the foreign ambassadors, and on March 9, by their advice,
he went on board the British ship of war, <i>Windsor Castle</i>, where he
summoned his son to appear before him. Dom Miguel thought it wisest to
obey; the king sent him abroad, and the attempt at a revolution was over
for the present. The junta appointed in the previous year to frame a
constitution now reported in favour of a revival of the ancient cortes,
and this proposal was accepted by the king. The cortes were not, however,
actually assembled; still, the mere fact of Dom Miguel's absence left the
government a little stronger.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_175" id="TOPIC_175"></a>Meanwhile, the relations between Portugal and Brazil occasioned
difficulties between the former country and Great Britain. On leaving
Brazil, King John VI. had entrusted the government to his elder son,
Peter, to whom he had given secret instructions to proclaim himself
Emperor of Brazil in case he found it impossible to maintain the union
between Brazil and the mother country. Acting on these instructions, Peter
had proclaimed the independence of Brazil on October 12, 1822, adopting
for himself the style of constitutional emperor. Next month Lord Cochrane,
who had been in the service of Chile, quitted it for that of Brazil.
Neither party in Portugal was prepared for the separation of Brazil, and
it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span> was therefore opposed, but without much effect, by the home
government. By the end of 1823 Cochrane had captured all the Portuguese
posts in Brazil, and in August, 1824, he suppressed a republican movement
in the north of that country. On July 23 of the same year Great Britain
signed a commercial treaty with the new empire. This irritated the
Portuguese government. Meanwhile, Beresford, who had returned to Portugal
in a private capacity, had been requested to resume the command of the
Portuguese army. This he refused to do so long as the Count of Subs&eacute;rra, a
French partisan, held office at home. There was a difficulty in forming a
ministry without him, and eventually Subs&eacute;rra became virtual prime
minister, and Beresford was excluded from office. In order to obtain an
excuse for the introduction of French troops into Portugal, Subs&eacute;rra sent
a request to Great Britain for a force of four or five thousand, knowing
it would be refused. Great Britain's refusal had not, however, the
expected consequence, because the influence of the other powers at Lisbon
was weakened by their anti-constitutional policy. <a name="TOPIC_176" id="TOPIC_176"></a>In July, 1825, the
representatives of Austria, Brazil, Great Britain, and Portugal assembled
at London to consider the relations of Portugal and Brazil. While the
conference was sitting it was discovered that Subs&eacute;rra was carrying on
separate negotiations with Brazil. Canning was now able to obtain his
dismissal, which was followed by the recall of the French ambassador, De
Neuville, who had been the principal opponent of British influence at
Lisbon. As a result of this conference the Portuguese government on August
29 recognised the independence of Brazil.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p>The restoration of absolute government in Spain revived the question of
Spanish America. Ferdinand VII., on recovering his authority, proposed a
congress at Paris for the consideration of South American affairs.
Canning, however, declined his invitation, and it was thought useless to
hold a congress without the participation of Great Britain. The position
in which Great Britain had been placed by the negotiations of Verona, as
diplomatic champion of Spain, had caused her to suspend her complaints
about the treatment of her merchant vessels trading with the revolted
colonies; but disorder continued, and on one occasion the British admiral
was authorised to land in Cuba to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span> extirpate the pirates using the Spanish
flag. Canning was determined that French force should not be employed to
reduce the revolted colonies, and in October, 1823, he informed the French
ambassador, Polignac, that he would acknowledge the independence of those
colonies if France assisted Spain in her attempts to reduce them<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>&mdash;a
somewhat empty threat, as the commercial interests of Great Britain would
have compelled him to acknowledge them in any case as soon as there should
be settled governments in existence with which he could treat. Diplomatic
agents were in fact appointed in most of the revolted colonies before the
end of this year.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE MONROE DOCTRINE.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_177" id="TOPIC_177"></a>What, however, rendered French interference hopeless was the attitude of
the United States, as expressed in President Monroe's historic message to
congress on December 2, 1823. In this message occur the words, since known
as the Monroe doctrine: "With the governments who have declared their
independence, and maintained it, and whose independence we have, on great
consideration, and on just principles, acknowledged, we could not view any
interposition for the purpose of oppressing them, or controlling in any
other manner their destiny, by any European power, in any other light than
as the manifestation of an unfriendly disposition towards the United
States." After this the recognition of the independence of the Spanish
colonies was only a matter of time.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> Great Britain recognised the
independence of Buenos Ayres, Colombia, and Mexico, in 1824, and the rest
soon after. In spite of the temporary successes of Canterac, Peru, the
last of the mainland provinces, was lost to Spain in 1825, and the other
European powers did not now delay their recognition of the American
republics. In April of that year France recognised the virtual
independence of her own revolted colony of Hayti.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_178" id="TOPIC_178"></a>The Eastern question advanced more slowly. On March 25, 1823, Canning
recognised the Greeks as belligerents. After this step Great Britain
enjoyed the advantage of being able to hold the Greek government
responsible for piracy committed by Greek ships; but, coming as it did
after the isolated action of Great Britain at Verona, it created a
suspicion among the eastern<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span> powers of a desire to effect a settlement of
the Eastern question without the co-operation of other states. In October,
1823, the Tsar Alexander and the Emperor Francis had a meeting at
Czernowitz in Bukowina. Here they discussed joint intervention in Greece
as a means of forestalling the isolated intervention of Great Britain.
During the meeting the news arrived of the Turkish concessions to the
Russian demands of 1821. Before the conference broke up, the tsar
informally suggested a conference at St. Petersburg to arrange joint
intervention on the basis of the erection of three principalities under
Turkish suzerainty in Greece and the &AElig;gean. In January, 1824, the same
proposal was made formally in a Russian circular addressed to the great
powers. Metternich and Canning both opposed the scheme, thinking that the
principalities would fall under Russian influence.</p>

<p>Metternich met it by a counter proposal for the complete independence of
Greece. Canning preferred to adopt neither course, and to watch the
sequence of events. In April, however, he consented that Great Britain
should be represented at the conference at St. Petersburg on condition
that no coercion should be applied to Turkey, and that diplomatic
relations should have been previously restored between Russia and Turkey;
in August the Greek government sent to London its protest against the
Russian proposals, and in November Canning, finding that neither Greeks
nor Turks would accept the decision of the conference, and being still
opposed to violent interference, refused to take part in it. At the same
time he offered British mediation to the Greeks in case it should be
absolutely necessary. Early in 1825 Metternich induced Charles X., the new
King of France, to support his proposal. Russia, however, would not hear
of the independence of Greece, which might mean the creation of a rival to
her influence in the Turkish dominions. The conference therefore merely
resolved that the Porte should grant satisfaction to its subjects, failing
which the powers offered their mediation.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE DEATH OF ALEXANDER I.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_179" id="TOPIC_179"></a>Turkey refused the offer. She was in fact busily engaged in restoring
order in her own way. In February, 1825, an Egyptian army was landed in
the Morea, and met with rapid successes of such a nature as to arouse a
suspicion that it was the fixed policy of its commander, Ibrahim, the
adopted son of Mehemet Ali,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span> Pasha of Egypt, to depopulate the Morea. His
advance upon Nauplia was checked by an order of the British commodore,
Hamilton, and he retired towards Tripolitza and Navarino. The Turkish
successes induced Canning to make proposals to Russia through Sir
Stratford Canning, the British ambassador at St. Petersburg, for a joint
intervention of the powers on condition that there should be no coercion
of Turkey. The tsar refused to accept the condition and made preparations
for war. Canning meanwhile declined an offer of the Greek government to
place itself under British protection, and on August 18 Alexander declared
that he would solve the Eastern question by himself. He then set out for
the south of Russia, where his army had collected. Canning now dropped his
scheme of an united intervention and opened negotiations for a separate
intervention on the part of Great Britain and Russia alone. Meanwhile he
informed the Greek government that he would allow no power to effect a
settlement without British co-operation, and that if Russia invaded Turkey
he would land troops in Greece. The negotiations with Russia were
proceeding favourably when they were interrupted by the death of Alexander
on December 1.</p>

<p>One event of the year 1825 which attracted little attention at the time
was destined to be a cause of friction at a much later date. In 1824 the
boundary between British America and the United States had been partially
delimited, and this was followed early in the following year by a treaty,
which attempted to settle the boundary between British and Russian
America. Unfortunately the words used in this treaty were somewhat
indefinite, and, although no difficulty was experienced for two
generations, the discovery of gold in the north-west of America
subsequently led to a bitter dispute between Canada on the one side and
the United States, which had acquired the rights of Russia, on the other.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<h3>TORY DISSENSION AND CATHOLIC RELIEF.</h3>


<p><a name="TOPIC_180" id="TOPIC_180"></a>The sudden illness of Liverpool in February, 1827, disclosed the dualism
and mutual jealousies which had enfeebled his cabinet. One section,
represented by Canning, advocated catholic emancipation, encouraged the
practical application of free trade doctrines, and was prepared to support
the principle of national independence, not only in South America, but in
Greece and Portugal. This section was dominant in the house of commons.
The other section, led by Wellington and Peel, which was dominant in the
house of lords, was strictly conservative on all these questions, though
Peel was beginning to show an open mind on one, at least, of them. The
king's known distrust of Canning, largely shared by his own party,
naturally suggested the hope of rallying it under the leadership of some
politician with the moderate and conciliatory temper of Lord Liverpool.
But no such politician could be found, nor was there any prospect of
Canning accepting a subordinate position in a new ministry. For nearly six
weeks the premiership was in abeyance, while Liverpool's recovery was
treated as a possible event. Canning himself was in broken health, but,
ill as he was, he proposed and carried in the house of commons a sliding
scale of import duties upon corn, variable with its market price. He also
made a fierce attack on Sir John Copley, then master of the rolls, who had
vigorously opposed a motion of Burdett for catholic relief. At last the
king, having consulted others, made up his mind to send for Canning, who
had been suffering from a relapse. It was in vain that Canning advised
him, unless he were prepared for concession on the catholic question, to
summon a body of ministers sharing his own convictions. There was, in
fact, no alternative to Canning's succession, except that of Wellington
or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span> Peel. The former declared that he would be worse than mad to accept
the premiership; the latter was still young for the office and deprecated
as hopeless the formation of any exclusively "protestant" cabinet. The
selection of Canning became inevitable, and on April 10 the king
determined upon it, irritated by what he regarded as an attempt to force
his hand in the choice of a minister.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CANNING ACCEPTS OFFICE.</i></div>

<p>From that moment, during the short remainder of his life Canning had to
undergo the same bitter experience as Pitt in 1804, and to suffer a cruel
retribution for his aggressive petulance. All his strongest colleagues,
except Huskisson, deserted him. The resignation of Lord Eldon, since 1821
Earl of Eldon, must have been expected, terminating, as it did, the
longest chancellorship since the Norman conquest. But Canning seems to
have really hoped that he might secure the support of Wellington by the
assurance of his desire to carry out the principles of Liverpool's
government. The duke, however, repelled his overtures with something less
than courtesy, and even retired from the command of the army. Peel had
already intimated privately that a transfer of the premiership from an
opponent to a champion of emancipation would make it impossible for him to
retain office. Three peers, Bathurst, Melville, and Westmorland, followed
his example. Canning had no resource but to enlist colleagues from the
ranks of the whigs. In this he was at first unsuccessful. Sturges Bourne
was appointed to the home office, Viscount Dudley became foreign
secretary, and Robinson, who was raised to the peerage as Viscount
Goderich, became secretary for war and the colonies. Canning himself
united the offices of first lord of the treasury and chancellor of the
exchequer. The Duke of Portland became lord privy seal. Palmerston, the
secretary at war, was given a seat in the cabinet. Harrowby, Huskisson,
Wynn, and Bexley, retained their former posts, and Sidmouth, hitherto an
unofficial member of the cabinet, finally retired. One important office
outside the cabinet, that of chief secretary for Ireland, was given to a
whig, William Lamb, afterwards Lord Melbourne. It was a happy idea to make
the Duke of Clarence lord high admiral without a seat in the cabinet, and
without any power of acting independently of his council, while Copley (as
Lord Lyndhurst) proved a good successor to Eldon.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_181" id="TOPIC_181"></a>In May some of the whigs were induced to join the ministry. Tierney
entered the cabinet as master of the mint and the Earl of Carlisle as
first commissioner of woods and forests. The Marquis of Lansdowne, the
former Lord Henry Petty, joined the cabinet without taking office. Other
minor posts were assigned to whigs, and several whig chiefs, such as
Holland and Brougham, while they remained outside the government, tendered
it a friendly support. In July Lansdowne became home secretary, Bourne was
transferred to the woods and forests department, Carlisle became lord
privy seal, and Portland remained in the cabinet without office.</p>

<p>The new cabinet was therefore still in an unsettled state when it met
parliament at the beginning of May. It there encountered a storm of
unsparing criticism even in the house of commons, but still more in the
house of lords. Lord Stewart, who had succeeded his brother as Marquis of
Londonderry, and the Duke of Newcastle denounced Canning in the most
intemperate language; and the veteran whig, Lord Grey, who had not been
consulted, delivered an elaborate oration against him not the less
virulent because it was carefully studied and measured. This attack was so
keenly felt by Canning that he was supposed to meditate the acceptance of
a peerage, that he might reply to it in person. The climax of his
vexations was reached when a corn bill, prepared by the late cabinet, and
passed by the house of commons, was finally wrecked in the house of lords
through an amendment introduced by Wellington. There was some excuse for
the duke's action in letters which had passed between him and Huskisson,
but Canning naturally resented his mischievous interposition, and unwisely
declared that he must "have been made an instrument in the hands of
others". So ended the session on July 2, amidst discords and divisions
which boded ill for the future, but threw a retrospective light on the
rare merits of Liverpool.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE DEATH OF CANNING.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_182" id="TOPIC_182"></a>The days of Canning were already numbered. Before the end of July he was
unable to attend a council, and retired for rest to the Duke of
Devonshire's villa at Chiswick. As in the case of Castlereagh, the king
had noticed the symptoms of serious illness, and on August 5 the public
was informed of his danger. On the 8th he died of internal inflammation in
the room which had witnessed the death of Fox. His loss was deeply felt,
not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span> only by the king who never showed him confidence, but also by the
best part of the nation, and his funeral was attended by a great concourse
of mourners, both whigs and tories. No one doubted that he was a patriot,
and his noble gifts commanded the admiration of his bitterest opponents.
He belonged to an age of transition, and it must ever be deplored that he
missed the opportunity of showing whether his mind was capable of further
growth in the highest office of state; for the inconsistencies of his
opinions, obstinately maintained for years, would have demanded many
changes of conviction or policy. He was as stout an enemy of reform at
home as he was a resolute friend of constitutional liberty abroad. He
detested the system of repression consecrated by the holy alliance, but he
defended the necessity of such measures as the six acts and arbitrary
imprisonment for a limited period. He never swerved in his advocacy of
Roman catholic relief, but he was unmoved by arguments in favour of
repealing the test and corporation acts. Probably, at the head of a
coalition, embracing the ablest of the moderate tories and reformers, and
loyally supported by his colleagues, he might have proved the foremost
British statesman of the nineteenth century. But it is more than doubtful
whether his proud and sensitive nature would have enabled him so to cancel
past memories as to consolidate such a coalition, or to inspire such
loyalty in its members.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_183" id="TOPIC_183"></a>The death of Canning involved for the moment far less political change
than might have been expected. The king at once sent for Sturges Bourne
and Goderich, as the most intimate adherents of Canning. He then commanded
Goderich to form, or rather to continue, a ministry of compromise, and
this was done with little shifting of places. Wellington resumed the
command of the army, thereby revealing his motive in giving it up so
abruptly. But a very unwise choice was made in the appointment of John
Charles Herries, rather than Palmerston, as chancellor of the exchequer,
and it carried with it the seeds of an early disruption. Palmerston had
originally been proposed for the office, but the king strongly favoured
Herries, though he showed good sense in deferring to public opinion, and
desiring Huskisson to take the post himself. Unfortunately, Huskisson
preferred the colonial office, and, as neither Sturges Bourne nor Tierney
would accept the position, royal influence prevailed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span> and Herries found
himself at the exchequer. Meanwhile Portland succeeded Harrowby as lord
president, Charles Grant succeeded Huskisson at the board of trade, and
Lord Uxbridge, who had been created Marquis of Anglesey after the battle
of Waterloo, and who was now master-general of the ordnance, was given a
seat in the cabinet.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_184" id="TOPIC_184"></a>In the course of November it was decided by Goderich, in concert with
Huskisson and Tierney, that a finance committee should be appointed early
in the next session to consider the state of the revenue. Lord Althorp,
the son of Earl Spencer, was designated as chairman, and provisionally
undertook to act, but the chancellor of the exchequer, who, contrary to
all precedent, had not been taken into counsel, strongly protested against
the nomination, as soon as he was informed of it. Out of this dispute
arose the ignoble fall of the Goderich administration, though it was
preceded by more serious dissensions on foreign policy. The king, whose
activity revived with the increasing weakness of his ministers, committed
himself, without asking their opinion, to a hearty approval of
Codrington's action at Navarino, in which, as will be recorded hereafter,
that admiral had co-operated in the destruction of the Turkish navy,
though the British government professed to be at peace with the Porte. The
king was also adverse to a proposal for the admission of Holland and
Wellesley into the cabinet. Goderich in consequence resigned, but had
withdrawn his resignation when the quarrel between Huskisson and Herries
broke out afresh. Driven to distraction by difficulties to which he was
utterly unequal, Goderich once more abandoned his post. The king gladly
dispensed with his services, and after some negotiation with Harrowby sent
for Wellington on January 9, 1828, giving him a free hand to invite any
co-operation except that of Grey. It was stipulated, however, "that the
Roman Catholic question was not to be made a cabinet question," and that
both the lord chancellors, as well as the lord lieutenant of Ireland, were
to be "protestants".<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>WELLINGTON PRIME MINISTER.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_185" id="TOPIC_185"></a>It must ever be regretted, for the sake of the country not less than of
his own fame, that Wellington undertook the premiership. He was beyond all
dispute the greatest man in England, and exercised up to the end of his
life a more power<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>ful influence in emergencies than any other subject. But
he had judged himself rightly when he declared that he was wholly unfit to
be prime minister, and his administration was among the weakest of modern
times. The firmness which had sustained him in so many campaigns, the
political sagacity which had enabled him to grapple with the complications
of Spanish affairs, and with the great settlement of Europe, equally
failed him in party management and in the estimation of public opinion at
home. He understood better than any man how to deal with the king, and
overbore not only the king's own prejudices but the machinations of the
Duke of Cumberland with masterly resolution. He set a good example in
declining to regard himself as a mere party leader and in refusing to
study the arts of popularity hunting, but he never grasped the principle
that constitutional government ultimately rests on the will of the people.
Still he was too good a general not to see when facts were too strong for
him. His chief man&oelig;uvres on the field of politics consisted in somewhat
inglorious though not unskilful retreats; when he afterwards carried
boldness to the point of rashness, he encountered a signal defeat.
Nevertheless, while he utterly lost his political hold on the masses, and
even the confidence of shrewd politicians, he never ceased to retain the
profound respect of his countrymen, not only as the first of English
generals, but as the most honest of public servants.</p>

<p>Wellington naturally applied first to Peel, and, by his advice, attempted
a reconstruction of the Goderich cabinet, but with the addition of certain
new elements. Five of Canning's followers&mdash;Lyndhurst, Dudley, who had been
created an earl, Huskisson, Grant, and Palmerston retained their old
offices, and Palmerston gave an extraordinary proof of patience by
cheerfully remaining secretary at war after eighteen years' service in
that capacity. These cabinet ministers were now joined or rejoined by Peel
as home secretary, Earl Bathurst as lord president, Henry Goulburn as
chancellor of the exchequer, Melville as president of the board of
control, Lord Aberdeen as chancellor of the duchy, and Lord Ellenborough,
son of the former chief justice, as lord privy seal. Herries was
transferred from the exchequer to the mastership of the mint. Outside the
cabinet Anglesey became lord lieutenant of Ireland, where Lamb remained
chief secretary. It was under<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>stood that Eldon, now in his seventy-seventh
year, would have willingly accepted the presidency of the council, and
felt hurt that no offer or communication was made to him. On the other
hand, the whigs were by no means satisfied, while the inclusion of
Huskisson equally offended extreme tories and the widow of Canning, who
spoke of him as having become an associate of her husband's murderers.
This association was not destined to be long lived. The formation of the
ministry was not completed until the end of January, and very soon after
parliament met on the 29th of that month a rupture between Huskisson and
Wellington became imminent. For this Huskisson was mainly responsible.
Having to seek re-election at Liverpool, and irritated by the attacks made
upon his consistency, he delivered a very imprudent speech, in which he
implied, if he did not state, that he had obtained from his chief pledges
of adhesion to Canning's policy. Such a declaration from such a man was
inevitably understood as applying at least to free trade and the conduct
of foreign affairs. Both Huskisson and the duke in parliamentary speeches
disclaimed the imputation of any bargain; still the rift was not closed,
and it was speedily widened by events on which harmony between tories and
friends of Canning was impossible.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_186" id="TOPIC_186"></a>For six years the so-called war of Greek independence had been carried on
with the utmost barbarity on both sides. The sympathies of Canning, as
foreign secretary, had been entirely with the Greeks, as they had been
with the South American insurgents, but he was equally on his guard
against the armed "mediation" of Russia and her claim to be the supreme
protector of the Greek Christians. We have seen how at last, in 1825,
hopeless discord between the great continental powers led to overtures for
the peaceful intervention of Great Britain, and how at this juncture the
Tsar Alexander died on December 1, 1825. Wellington, at Canning's request,
undertook a special embassy to St. Petersburg for the ostensible purpose
of congratulating the new tsar, Nicholas, on his accession, and succeeded,
during April, 1826, in concluding an arrangement for joint action by
Russia and Great Britain with a view to establishing the autonomy of
Greece under the sovereignty of Turkey. Meanwhile the impulsive enthusiasm
which has so often seized the English people on behalf of "oppressed
nationalities" had been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span> fanned into a flame by the cause of Greek
independence. Byron had already sacrificed his life to it in April, 1824;
Cochrane now devoted to it an energy and a naval reputation only second to
Nelson's; volunteers joined the Greek levies, and subscriptions came in
freely. In the course of 1826 Canning succeeded in procuring the adhesion
of the French government to the Anglo-Russian agreement. Early in 1827 the
three powers demanded an armistice from Turkey, and, on the refusal of the
Porte, signed the treaty of London for the settlement of the Greek
question. This treaty, dated July 6, 1827, was almost the last public act
of Canning. It was moderate in its terms, embodying the conditions laid
down in the previous year at St. Petersburg, and making the
self-government of Greece subject to a payment of tribute to the Porte. It
provided for a combination of the British, French, and Russian fleets in
the event of a second refusal from Turkey; but Canning died in the hope
that hostilities might be avoided.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>NAVARINO.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_187" id="TOPIC_187"></a>This hope was not likely, nor was it destined, to be realised. The Porte
remained inflexible, and would grant no armistice; indeed, it had summoned
a contingent of ships from Egypt, and a fleet of twenty-eight sail under
Ibrahim Pasha was lying in the Bay of Navarino awaiting further
reinforcements. Admiral Codrington, who commanded the allied fleet, now
before Navarino, showed much forbearance. In concert with the French
admiral, he warned Ibrahim Pasha not to leave the harbour, and obtained
assurances which were speedily broken. Futile negotiations went on during
the early part of October, ending in a massacre among the inhabitants of
the coast by the direction of Ibrahim. The admirals of the allied fleet no
longer hesitated. On the 20th the fleet entered the harbour. The first
shots were fired by the Turco-Egyptian fleet, which was skilfully ranged
in three lines, and in the form of a horseshoe. An action ensued, which
lasted four hours, and resulted in the almost complete destruction of the
Ottoman armament. Had the allied fleet at once proceeded to
Constantinople, the Greek question might perhaps have been settled
promptly, instead of being left to perplex cabinets for two years longer.</p>

<p>The news of Navarino reached England when the ministry of Lord Goderich
was already tottering, and caused its members far more anxiety than
satisfaction. Probably the wisest of them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span> foresaw that, unless immediate
action were taken, Russia would declare war single-handed against Turkey
and enforce her own terms, but nothing in fact was done, and Wellington,
on coming into power, found the question of our relations with Turkey and
Greece still open. In spite of his own share in bringing about the
co-operation of Russia with Great Britain, he was by no means prepared for
a crusade on behalf of Greek independence, or for a definite rupture with
Turkey. Hence the memorable phrases inserted in the king's speech of
January 29, 1828, which described the battle of Navarino as "a collision
wholly unexpected by His Majesty" and as "an untoward event," which His
Majesty hoped would not be followed by further hostilities. These
expressions, however much in accord with the pacific tone of the treaty of
London, provoked an outburst of indignation from the friends of Greece in
both houses. Lords Holland and Althorp, Lord John Russell, and Brougham
recorded earnest protests against any disparagement of Admiral
Codrington's action. The infatuation of the Porte, and the consequent war
with Russia, checked further agitation on the subject, and Wellington's
government was able to fall back on the policy of non-intervention
proposed, though not always practised, by Canning. But the reactionary
tendency of Wellington's foreign policy betrayed in the king's speech had
its effect in alienating the more liberal of his colleagues. Nor was his
position strengthened by his irresolute home policy. During the session of
1828 issues were raised which inevitably divided and ultimately broke up
the cabinet.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>TEST ACTS REPEALED.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_188" id="TOPIC_188"></a>The first of these difficulties was caused by the success of Lord John
Russell's motion for the repeal of the test and corporation acts, under
which dissenters were precluded from holding municipal and other offices.
It was, indeed, a grave blot on the consistency of reformers that, while
the claims of Roman catholics, and especially of Irish Roman catholics,
had been vehemently urged for nearly thirty years, those of protestant
nonconformists had been coldly neglected. Their legal disabilities, it is
true, had gradually become almost nominal, and an indemnity act was passed
yearly to cover the constant breaches of the obnoxious law. Still, the law
was maintained, and was stoutly defended by such tories as Eldon on the
principle that it was an important outwork of the union between Church
and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span> State. Even the Canningite members of the government supported it
against Russell's attack, but on the very opposite ground&mdash;that it had
become a dead letter. However, the measure for its repeal was carried in
the house of commons by a majority of forty-four, including some
well-known Churchmen. This measure would assuredly have been rejected in
the house of lords had not Peel judiciously procured the insertion of a
clause substituting for the sacramental test a declaration binding the
office-holder to do nothing hostile to the Church. Thus modified, it
passed the house of lords, with the assent of several bishops, in spite of
the implacable opposition of Lords Eldon and Redesdale, and the Duke of
Cumberland. But the declaration was amended by the addition of the words
"upon the true faith of a Christian," which incidentally continued the
statutable exclusion of Jews.</p>

<p>The enforced acceptance of this enactment was equivalent to a decisive
reverse, and could not but injure the prestige of the government, but it
did not actually cause a schism in the cabinet. It was otherwise when the
duke proposed a corn bill in lieu of that rejected at his instance in the
previous year. The difference between these measures was not very
material, but the duke insisted upon certain regulations of detail, which
Huskisson persistently opposed. Peel suggested a compromise which, after
long altercation and some threats of resignation, was adopted. But the
effect was to weaken the government still further in the eyes of the
public, inasmuch as the principle of duties on a graduated scale had
prevailed at last against the declared opinions of the duke. The
inevitable rupture was only deferred for a few weeks, and arose out of
motions for disfranchising East Retford and Penryn&mdash;a premonitory symptom
of the great reform bill. These were among the most corrupt of the old
"rotten boroughs," and the scandalous practices which flourished in both
of them had more than once shocked even the unreformed parliament. In 1827
a bill for disfranchising Penryn had actually been carried by the house of
commons in spite of Canning's dissent, and one for disfranchising East
Retford would probably have been carried, but that it was introduced too
late.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_189" id="TOPIC_189"></a>The motions now introduced by Lord John Russell and Charles Tennyson
respectively could scarcely have been thrown<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span> out by the same house, but
squabbles arose in the cabinet, partly on the comparative guiltiness of
the two venal constituencies, but chiefly on the disposal of the seats to
be vacated. It was agreed at last that Penryn should be merged in the
adjacent hundred, and the majority of the cabinet, represented by Peel,
were for dealing in like manner with East Retford. The liberal section,
however, represented by Huskisson, was bent on transferring its
representation to Birmingham, and voted against Peel in the house of
commons. Having thus vindicated his independence, Huskisson, somewhat too
hastily, placed his resignation in the hands of the premier on May 20. The
duke, having fairly lost patience with his insubordinate colleagues, was
equally prompt in accepting it, and declined to receive the explanations
offered. In the end, Palmerston, Dudley, Grant, and Lamb, followed the
fortunes of Huskisson, and Wellington's government was completely purged
of Canning's old supporters.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE CLARE ELECTION.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_190" id="TOPIC_190"></a>Two military officers, without political experience, were now imported
into the ministry. Sir George Murray succeeded Huskisson at the colonial
office, and Sir Henry Hardinge replaced Palmerston as secretary at war,
but was not admitted to the cabinet; Lord Aberdeen became foreign
secretary, and Vesey Fitzgerald president of the board of trade, while
Lord Francis Leveson Gower succeeded Lamb as chief secretary for Ireland.
So purely tory an administration had not been formed since the days of
Perceval. Looking back we can see that, for that very reason, it was
doomed; but to politicians of 1828 Wellington's ascendency seemed assured,
and it was not actually broken for above two years. By far the most
important event of domestic history within that period was the crisis
ending in the catholic emancipation act, and this crisis was immediately
precipitated by the almost casual appointment of Vesey Fitzgerald. He was
a popular Irish landlord, who had always supported catholic relief, and
his re-election for the county of Clare was regarded as perfectly secure.
The landlords were known to be entirely in his favour, and Irish tenants,
miscalled "forty shilling freeholders," had been used to vote obsequiously
for the candidate of their landlords. Indeed, these counterfeit freeholds
had been manufactured recklessly throughout Ireland for the very purpose
of extending landlord influence. Perhaps the recent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span> defeat of a Beresford
at Waterford by a nominee of Daniel O'Connell, who had made himself the
leader of the movement for Catholic relief, ought to have undeceived the
Irish tories, but no one could have foreseen so daring an act as the
candidature of O'Connell himself, notwithstanding that, as a catholic, he
was incapable of sitting in the house of commons.</p>

<p>The contest began on June 30 and lasted five days. All the gentry and
electors of the higher class supported Fitzgerald, but all the poorer
electors, headed by their priests, flocked to the poll and voted for
O'Connell, who, on Fitzgerald's retirement, was triumphantly elected. The
violence of O'Connell's language was unmeasured, and as was said by Sheil,
"every altar became a tribune," but perfect order was maintained
throughout. The terrorism which has since disgraced Irish elections and
vitiated the whole representation of Ireland had no place in this
startling victory, and the impression produced by it was thereby
infinitely enhanced. Two conclusions were instantly drawn from it: the
one, that electoral power in Ireland could not safely be left in the hands
of the forty-shilling freeholders; the other, that, whether or not they
were disfranchised, nothing short of political equality of the catholics
of Ireland could avert the risk of civil war. It is seldom that momentous
changes can be so clearly traced to a single cause as in the case of
catholic emancipation. The whole interval between July, 1828, and April,
1829, was occupied by the discussion of this question, or circumstances
arising out of it, and it may truly be said to have filled the whole
horizon of domestic politics. The first and final recognition by a
responsible government of emancipation as a political necessity dates
immediately from the Clare election.</p>

<p>The question of catholic emancipation had been the only reason for the
resignation of Pitt in 1801, but we have seen that he resumed office in
1804 under a pledge not to re-open it. It is certain that he never
contemplated a complete emancipation of the catholics without safeguards
for the interests of the established church. Such a safeguard (though
ineffective against a future attack through disestablishment) was provided
by the act of union,<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> which inviolably united the Irish and English
churches. The catholic leaders, on their part, were profuse in their
disavowals of hostility to that establishment and to the protestant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
government in Ireland. In their first solemn memorial, presented by
Grenville on March 25, 1805, they expressly declared that "they do not
seek or wish, in the remotest degree, to injure or encroach upon the
rights, privileges, immunities, possessions, and revenues appertaining to
the bishops and clergy of the protestant religion, or to the churches
committed to their charge". They further volunteered an expression of
their belief that no evil act could be justified by the good of the
Church, and that papal infallibility was no article of the catholic faith.
Thenceforward, frequent motions in support of the "catholic claims" were
made in both houses of parliament. In 1810 such a motion was proposed in a
very eloquent speech by Grattan, but Castlereagh, though a staunch friend
of the cause, deprecated it as inopportune, since the catholics had
injured themselves by imprudent conduct, and fresh declarations
inconsistent with their former assurances. The motion was therefore
rejected, and a similar fate befell motions of the same kind in the two
following years, especially in the house of lords, where Eldon inflexibly
resisted any concession, and always commanded a majority.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CATHOLIC RELIEF.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_191" id="TOPIC_191"></a>When Liverpool replaced Perceval as prime minister in 1812, catholic
emancipation became an open question in the cabinet. In that year Canning
succeeded in carrying triumphantly a resolution pledging the house of
commons to consider the question seriously in the next session, and a like
resolution was only lost by one vote in the house of lords. Accordingly,
in 1813, Grattan's motion for a committee of the whole house on catholic
disabilities was accepted, and a bill for their removal passed its second
reading. But it was loaded with vexatious securities in committee and
wrecked by the vigorous opposition of the speaker, Abbot, who on May 24
carried by a majority of four an amendment withholding the right to sit
and vote in parliament. After this, the bill was of course abandoned, but
another was unanimously passed exempting from penalties Roman catholics
holding certain military and civil offices, to which, by a harsh
construction of law, they were not eligible. In 1817 the question was
debated at great length in the house of commons, and several leading men
took part in it, but the motion for catholic relief was again defeated by
a majority of twenty-four. It was revived in 1819 by Grattan, who
delivered on this occasion one of his greatest speeches, and succeeded in
reducing the majority to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span> two only. In 1821 a further advance was made by
Plunket's success in obtaining a committee to consider the claims of the
catholics. This was carried by a majority of six, and followed up by two
bills, removing all catholic disabilities with very slight exceptions, but
subject to stringent and somewhat illusory securities for the loyalty of
the priesthood. Ultimately on April 2 a comprehensive measure of catholic
relief passed the house of commons by a majority of nineteen. All the most
influential members of the lower house now voted in its favour, but the
attitude of the upper house remained unchanged. The spirit of Eldon still
ruled the peers, and his speech against Plunket's relief bill contains a
complete armoury of protestant arguments. But the catholics had a still
more doughty opponent in the Duke of York, who delivered on this occasion
the first of his famous declarations, binding himself to life-long
hostility. As Eldon said, "he did more to quiet this matter than
everything else put together".<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<p>The year 1821 marks a turning point in the history of the catholic
question, since the protestant cause, no longer safe in the house of
commons, was felt by its champions to depend on the crown and the house of
lords. But it would be an error to suppose that catholic relief was ever a
popular cry in this country, like retrenchment and reform. On the
contrary, the feelings of the masses in Great Britain were never roused in
regard to it, and, if roused at all, would probably have been enlisted on
the other side. It would be too much to say that the controversy was
merely academical, for it was keen enough to split up parties and produce
dualism in cabinets. But it was never a hustings question. It filled a
much larger space in the minds of statesmen than in the minds of the
people, and even among statesmen it was so far secondary that it could be
treated as an open question in Liverpool's ministry for a period of
fifteen years. No doubt the disturbed state of Ireland, which ultimately
supplied the motive power for carrying the emancipation act, contributed
at an earlier stage to damp the zeal of its advocates. Whatever the merits
of the union, it had failed to pacify the country, thereby verifying the
warning of Cornwallis, that, although Ireland could not be saved without<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
the union, "you must not take it for granted that it will be saved by it".</p>

<p>In 1800, the very year of the union, the <i>habeas corpus</i> act had been
suspended and another act passed for the suppression of rebellion. Though
repealed in the following year, these coercive measures were renewed in
1803, after Emmet's abortive rising, and continued in 1804. In 1805, when
they expired, special commissions were appointed for the repression of
crime in the south and west of Ireland. In 1807 the <i>habeas corpus</i> act
was again suspended and a rigorous insurrection act passed which continued
in force until 1810. In that year a Catholic Committee was formed,
anticipating the more notorious Catholic Association. An essential part of
the scheme was the formation of a representative assembly in Dublin, to
discuss and procure redress for the wrongs of catholics. This project was
put down by the Irish government, which treated it as a breach of the
convention act of 1793. The next ten years seem to have been somewhat
quieter in Ireland, and the disturbances which followed the peace in Great
Britain had no counterpart in that country. Still, it was thought
necessary to suppress another catholic convention in 1814, and to renew
the insurrection act, which remained in force with one interval till 1817.
It can well be imagined that a population so lawless, and so prone to
horrible outrages which shock Englishmen more than a thousand crimes
against property, should have excited little general sympathy by their
complaints of political grievances. These grievances were justly denounced
by party leaders, but in the eyes of ordinary politicians, and still more
of electors, coercion rather than concession was the appropriate remedy
for the ills of Ireland.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CATHOLIC RELIEF.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_192" id="TOPIC_192"></a>Canning, however, though suspected of lukewarmness, did not let the
question rest in 1822. On April 30, while still out of office, he
introduced a bill which he could scarcely have expected to become law, for
enabling Roman catholic peers to sit and vote in the house of lords. This
bill was passed in the commons by a majority of five, but rejected in the
lords by a majority of forty-four, in spite of somewhat transparent
assertions that it was not intended to prejudice the main issue. On April
18, 1823, an angry protest from Burdett against the "annual farce" of
motions leading to nothing was followed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span> by a quarrel between Canning and
Brougham, who accused Canning, then foreign secretary, of "monstrous
truckling for the purpose of obtaining office"; and when Plunket moved, as
usual, for the relief of catholics, a temporary secession of radicals took
place, which left him in a ridiculous minority. In spite of this
discomfiture, Lord Nugent succeeded in carrying through the commons a
bill, granting the parliamentary franchise to Roman catholics in Great
Britain. The bill was lost in the lords, and the question remained dormant
in 1824; but in 1825 it received a fresh impulse. This time it was Burdett
who, at the instance of Lansdowne and Brougham, appeared as spokesman of
the catholics. His action was in some respects inopportune, as the
"Catholic Association," founded by O'Connell and Sheil in 1823, was now
usurping the functions of a government, and regularly levying taxes under
the name of "rent". The necessity of suppressing it, though not apparent
to Lord Wellesley, the lord-lieutenant, was strongly felt on both sides of
the house of commons. A bill for this purpose, but applicable to all
similar associations, was rapidly carried by large majorities in both
houses, and the opposition was fain to rely mainly on the declaration that
it would be put in force against catholic associations only, and not
against those of the Orangemen, as the more violent of the Irish
protestants were called. It is needless to say that it was evaded by the
former, but on March 1, while it was still before the house of lords,
Burdett took courage to move another preliminary resolution in favour of
the catholics, and obtained a majority of thirteen. A bill founded on this
resolution was at once introduced.</p>

<p>The debates on this bill were memorable in several respects and opened the
last stage but one in the long history of catholic relief. In the first
place, more than one opponent publicly avowed his conversion to it; in the
second place, now that its "settlement" was actually within view, the
necessity of providing a counterpoise became admitted. Accordingly, one
independent member proposed a state grant of &pound;250,000 a year for the
endowment of the catholic clergy, who might thus be indirectly bound over
to good behaviour, while another proposed the disfranchisement of the 40s.
freeholders. Both of these bills were read a second time, but held over
until the fate of the main relief bill should be determined. That bill
passed the house<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span> of commons on May 10, 1825, by a majority of twenty-one,
and Peel tendered his resignation to Lord Liverpool.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> Two days later,
the Duke of York, on presenting a petition against the bill in the house
of lords, delivered another speech which fell like a thunder-clap on the
country, and has been celebrated ever since as an audacious breach of
constitutional usage. In this speech, he justified the inflexible attitude
of his father, whose mental disorder he expressly attributed to the
agitation of the catholic question. He concluded by declaring that his
principles were the same, imbibed in early youth and confirmed by mature
reflection, and that he would maintain them up to the latest moment of his
existence, "whatever might be his situation in life". It is certain that,
in thus pledging himself, he acted without having consulted the king, who
somewhat resented so direct an allusion to his prospect of succession.
Still, the sensation produced by the duke's utterance was prodigious, and
he remained the favourite champion of the protestant cause until his
death. Brougham attacked him with furious sarcasm in the commons, but the
lords threw out Burdett's relief bill by a majority of forty-eight, and
the No-popery cry influenced the general election of 1826. In that year no
further effort was made by the friends of catholic claims, but O'Connell
showed his growing power in Ireland by exciting a political revolt of the
peasantry at Waterford, and procuring the defeat of Lord George Beresford.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CATHOLIC RELIEF.</i></div>

<p>In the session of 1827, before Canning succeeded Lord Liverpool, Burdett
renewed his motion of 1825 on the catholic question, but found himself
defeated by four votes. The division had taken place in a full house,
after the fierce encounter, already mentioned, between Copley and Canning;
but it cannot be regarded as a decisive token of contrast between the old
and the new parliament, since relief was now claimed without any mention
of "securities". The subject was in abeyance during the short
administrations of Canning and Goderich, but was raised again by Burdett
in May, 1828, after the repeal of the test and corporation acts. The
number of votes on the catholic side, 272, was the same as in 1827, that
on the protestant side, 266, was less by ten, the result being a majority
of six for the motion. A similar resolution was lost in the house of
lords, as a matter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span> of course; but the language held by the new lord
chancellor, Lyndhurst, and by Wellington himself, as prime minister,
prepared observant men for an impending change of policy. Then followed
the Clare election, which revealed nothing which might not have been
foreseen, but which had the same effect in precipitating the removal of
catholic disabilities as the Irish famine afterwards had in precipitating
the repeal of the corn laws.</p>

<p>We now know that Peel had made up his mind to yield shortly after the
Clare election,<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> partly influenced by the alarming reports of Anglesey,
the Irish lord-lieutenant, on the state of Ireland. We also know that
Wellington himself was more than half convinced of the necessity of
concession, and was preparing to strengthen his government for the coming
struggle, in the event of Peel feeling bound to retire. Meanwhile a
vacancy in the ministry had been created by the Duke of Clarence's
resignation of his office of lord high admiral. In spite of the
limitations imposed on his power, he had insisted on hoisting his flag,
and assumed command. For this he was severely reprehended by the king and
Wellington, and was virtually forced to resign office. Melville now became
once more first lord of the admiralty, and was succeeded by Ellenborough
at the board of control. Ellenborough retained his former office of lord
privy seal, which Wellington was holding in reserve with a view to
strengthening the government. But the public of those days remained in
entire ignorance of their intentions until the meeting of parliament on
February 5, 1829.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_193" id="TOPIC_193"></a>The speech of George Dawson, Peel's brother-in-law, at Derry, on August
12, had greatly startled protestants. As it was never publicly disavowed,
Brunswick clubs were formed to repel the rising tide of sympathy with the
catholics, but the only tangible indication of Wellington's personal
sentiments favoured the belief that nothing would be done. The
circumstances under which this indication was given were peculiar. The
duke had written a letter to the Roman catholic archbishop of Dublin, an
old correspondent, deprecating agitation on the catholic question, as
likely to prejudice its future settlement, of which, however, the duke saw
"no prospect".<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> This letter was improperly sent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span> by the archbishop to
O'Connell as well as to Anglesey. O'Connell read it to the Catholic
Association as a sign of conciliatory inclinations; Anglesey's reply
suggested, at least, that agitation might continue. He was promptly
recalled, and his recall was rendered the more significant by the
appointment of the Duke of Northumberland, a known "protestant," as his
successor. What the public could not then know was that behind all other
difficulties, political or personal, lay the almost insuperable difficulty
of inducing the king to allow the cabinet to be even consulted. Indolent
and unprincipled as George IV. was, he was still capable of rousing and
asserting himself. Probably no one but Wellington could have prevailed
against his anti-catholic prejudices, shared, as they were, not only by
most of the peers, both spiritual and temporal, but also by the mass of
the English people. At this juncture Peel informed the duke that, rather
than risk the success of the proposed measure, he would remain at his
post. His example was followed by his "protestant" colleagues.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE INTRODUCTION OF THE RELIEF BILL.</i></div>

<p>During the winter of 1828-29 the strongest pressure was brought to bear on
the king by his ministers to procure his consent to a measure of relief,
accompanied by safeguards. Though he afterwards assured Eldon that he had
never explicitly given such a consent, the old chancellor, on seeing the
documents, felt obliged to express a contrary opinion. It is certain that
he gave way most reluctantly, and probable that his scruples were as
sincere as was consistent with his character; but he knew well that, if he
dismissed his ministers, he would be left isolated, and he bowed to
necessity. Indeed even the "protestant" members of the cabinet had urged
him to yield. His assent was, in fact, only given by degrees; after each
member of the cabinet, who had previously opposed catholic emancipation,
had had a separate interview, the king consented on January 15 to the
consideration of the subject by the cabinet, but reserved the right to
reject its advice. After this no great difficulty was experienced in
obtaining the royal assent to the introduction of a bill.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> Accordingly
the king's speech, delivered by commission on February 5, 1829, distinctly
recommended parliament to consider whether the civil disabilities of the
catho<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>lics could not be removed "consistently with the full and permanent
security of our establishments in Church and State". This recommendation,
however, was preceded by a severe condemnation of the Catholic Association
and the expression of a resolution to put down the disorders caused by it.
The sensation produced by the king's speech was increased by the
simultaneous resignation by Peel of his seat for the university of Oxford.
Considering that he was originally preferred to Canning mainly on
protestant grounds, he could not have honourably acted otherwise. Many of
his old friends stood by him, in spite of differences on the catholic
question, and Eldon's grandson, who had been proposed as a candidate, was
set aside as too weak an opponent. Ultimately Sir Robert Inglis was put
forward by the "protestants," and was returned by 755 votes against 609.
Peel obtained a seat for the borough of Westbury,<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> and moved a
preliminary bill for suppressing the Catholic Association. This passed
both houses in February, but was already ineffective when it became law,
since the association had been shrewd enough to dissolve itself upon the
advice of its English well-wishers. The catholic relief bill was therefore
introduced under favourable auspices.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_194" id="TOPIC_194"></a>The motives which actuated Wellington and Peel in espousing the cause
which they had so persistently opposed admit of no doubt whatever. In the
memoir which Peel left as embodying his own defence, no less than in his
speech introducing the emancipation bill, he affects no essential change
of conviction. He rests his case entirely on the public danger of leaving
the question "unsettled" after the disclosures of the Clare election, and
argues calmly, as the agitators had been arguing for nearly thirty years,
that no settlement was practicable short of complete, though not
unconditional, surrender. There is no pretence of consistency. All the
constitutional, political, and religious objections to civil equality
between protestants and catholics in Ireland remained unanswered and
unabated. Indeed the increasing power and defiant tone of the catholic
demagogues might well have appeared a crowning reason for refusing them
seats in parliament. Peel, however, had adopted, and pressed upon
Wellington, the delusive opinion of Anglesey that by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span> "taking them from
the Association and placing them in the house of commons" they might be
reduced to comparative impotence. He lamented, it is true, the premature
announcement of a new policy by Dawson, and he had submitted his own
resignation to the duke in the belief, apparently sincere, that he could
render better service in an independent position. But he seems not to have
felt the least scruple in urging the duke to break all his pledges to his
protestant supporters, and conciliate the followers of O'Connell. Nor did
his advice fall on unwilling ears. Trained in a vocation where private
conscience is subordinate to military duty, where enemies must sometimes
be welcomed as allies if it may further the plan of campaign, and where a
masterly retreat is as honourable as a victory, Wellington did not shrink
from undertaking the part of an opportunist minister. He had always
regarded himself as a servant of the crown and the nation, rather than as
a party leader, and he saw no personal difficulty in adopting any
political measure as the less of two evils. Having once satisfied himself
that civil war in Ireland was the only alternative to emancipation, he
abandoned resistance to it as he would have abandoned a hopeless siege,
and called upon his tory followers to change their front with him.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_195" id="TOPIC_195"></a>Notice had been given of a resolution to be moved by Peel on March 5,
preparing the way for the catholic relief bill, when the king raised fresh
obstacles to its progress. As the day drew near, George, encouraged by the
Duke of Cumberland, grew very excited. He had violent interviews with his
ministers, and finally on March 3 he informed Wellington, Lyndhurst, and
Peel that he could not assent to any alteration in the oath of supremacy.
The three ministers accordingly tendered their resignations, which were
accepted. But the king soon found that no alternative administration was
possible, and on the following day the existing ministers received
permission to proceed with the bill.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>PROVISIONS OF THE RELIEF BILL.</i></div>

<p>Peel's great speech on March 5, in favour of his resolution, contains a
comprehensive review of the Irish question, as well as an elaborate
defence of his own position, resting solely on grounds of expediency. He
advocated the measure itself as the only means of pacifying Ireland,
reducing the undue power<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span> of the catholics, and securing the protestant
religion. It was simple in its main outlines, applying to the whole United
Kingdom, and purporting to open all political and civil rights to
catholics, with a very few specified exceptions. It contained, however, a
number of provisions, in the nature of securities against catholic
aggression. By the new oath, to be substituted for the oaths of
allegiance, supremacy, and abjuration, a member of parliament, or holder
of an office, was no longer required to renounce transubstantiation, the
invocation of saints, or the sacrifice of the mass. But he was still
obliged not only to swear allegiance, but to profess himself resolved to
maintain the protestant settlement of the crown, to condemn absolutely all
papal jurisdiction within the realm, and to disclaim solemnly any
intention of subverting the existing Church establishment or weakening the
system of protestant government. Moreover, priests were expressly denied
the privilege of sitting in parliament. Catholics were still excluded from
the high positions of sovereign, regent, lord chancellor of England or
Ireland, and lord-lieutenant of Ireland. They were enabled to become
ministers of the crown, but were debarred from the power of advising the
crown on presentations to ecclesiastical dignities or benefices, nor were
they allowed to exercise such patronage in their personal capacity. They
were still to be disabled from holding offices in the ecclesiastical
courts, or in the universities, and their bishops were forbidden to assume
diocesan titles already appropriated by the establishment. Other clauses
were directed against the use of catholic vestments except in their
chapels and private houses, and against the importation of Jesuits or
members of similar religious orders, with a saving clause for those
already resident and duly registered. Two other safeguards, often
proposed, were deliberately omitted from the bill. There was no provision
for a state endowment of catholic priests, or for a veto of the crown on
the appointment of catholic bishops. These omissions, whether justifiable
or not, were pregnant with serious consequences.</p>

<p>The debates in both houses on Peel's bill, as it was rightly considered,
are chiefly interesting as throwing light on contemporary opinion. The
arguments for and against it had been fairly exhausted in previous years,
and would carry no great weight in a later age. The constitutional
objections to it, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span> seemed vital to Eldon, and weighty to every
statesman of his time, were at a later date put aside, when they were
pleaded against the dissolution of the Irish church, directly guaranteed
by the act of union. The criticisms on the personal consistency of
Wellington and Peel belong to biography rather than to history. But no one
can read the speeches of leading men on either side without recognising
the superior foresight, at least, of those who opposed the bill, and
distrusted the efficacy of the safeguards embodied in it. Two assumptions
underlay the whole discussion, and were treated as axioms by nearly all
the speakers. The one was that catholic emancipation must be judged by its
effect on the future peace of Ireland; the other, that it could not be
justified, unless it would strengthen, rather than weaken, protestant
ascendency, then regarded as a bulwark of the constitution. Posterity may
contemplate it from a different and perhaps higher point of view; but it
is certain that, if its consequences had been foreseen by those who voted
upon it, the bill would have been rejected. It is no less certain that its
adoption was a victory of the educated classes, represented by
nomination-boroughs, over the unrepresented masses of the people.</p>

<p>The actual result in the division lists was all that its promoters could
have desired. Though the secret had been so well kept by the government
that few of its supporters knew what to expect, and though piles of
petitions showed the preponderance of protestant sentiment outside
parliament, that sentiment was not reflected in the division lists. The
first reading of the bill in the house of commons was carried by a
majority of 348 to 160; the second reading by a majority of 353 to 180;
the third reading by a majority of 320 to 142. The debates were enlivened
on the protestant side by a brilliant speech from Michael Sadler, a tory
friend of the working classes, returned by the Duke of Newcastle for
Newark, and a violent invective from Sir Charles Wetherell, the
attorney-general, who was thereupon dismissed from office. Peel, who had
borne the brunt of these attacks, replied on March 30, when the bill was
sent up to the lords, and on April 2, the second reading of it in the
upper house was moved by Wellington. His candid admission that he was
driven to concession by the fear of civil war has since become historical,
and served as the watchword of many a lawless agitation in Ireland. It was
natural that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span> most of the peers, and especially of the spiritual peers,
who took part in the discussion should be opponents of the measure, but
Lloyd, Bishop of Oxford, severed himself from the rest of his order, and
vigorous speeches were made in support of it by Anglesey and Grey, neither
of whom could be regarded as friendly to Wellington's government.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>ROYAL ASSENT TO THE BILL.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_196" id="TOPIC_196"></a>Anglesey, who had been recently dismissed from the lord-lieutenancy of
Ireland, went beyond the duke in the use of purely military arguments;
Grey ventured to prophesy not only a future reign of peace in Ireland, but
an extension of protestantism, as the consequence of catholic
emancipation. The hopeless attempt of Lyndhurst to vindicate his own
consistency, and a forensic duel between Eldon and Plunket, who had been
raised to the peerage in 1827, relieved the monotony of the debate, but
probably did not influence a single vote. The old guard of the
anti-catholic party remained firm, but the mass of tory peers followed
their leader in his new policy, as they had followed him in his old, and
the relief bill was read a third time in the house of lords on the 10th,
by a majority of 104. Three days later it received the royal assent. Lord
Eldon had virtually encouraged the king to refuse this, at the last
moment, though he was too honest to accept the assurance of George IV.
that the bill was introduced without his authority. But the son of George
III. had not inherited his father's resolute character. After a few
childish threats of retiring to Hanover and leaving the Duke of Clarence
to make terms with the ministry, he abandoned further resistance and
capitulated to Wellington, as Wellington had capitulated to O'Connell.</p>

<p>The disfranchisement of the forty-shilling freeholders and the
substitution of a ten-pound suffrage was the price to be paid for catholic
emancipation, and no time was lost in completing the bargain. In days when
it is assumed that every change in the electoral franchise must needs be
in a downward direction, it may well appear amazing that so wholesale a
destruction of privileges enjoyed for thirty-six years should have
provoked so feeble an opposition. It is still more amazing that it should
have passed without a protest from O'Connell himself, who had solemnly
vowed to perish on the field or on the scaffold rather than submit to it.
Yet so it was. These ignorant voters, it is true, had never ventured to
call<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span> their souls their own, and had only ceased to be the servile
creatures of their landlords in order to become the servile creatures of
their priests. Still, it was they who, by their action in the Waterford
and Clare elections, had forced the hand of the government, and achieved
catholic emancipation. It may safely be said that after the reform act of
1832 it would have been politically impossible to disfranchise them; and
even in the unreformed parliament it would have been scarcely possible if
gratitude were a trustworthy motive in politics. On the other hand, the
government could never have secured a majority for catholic emancipation,
unless it had been distinctly understood to carry with it the extinction
of democracy in Ireland. This, rather than declarations and restrictions
of doubtful efficacy, was the real "security" on which the legislature
relied for disarming the disloyalty of Irish catholics. For some time it
answered its purpose so far as to keep the representation of that
disloyalty within safe limits in the house of commons. But it naturally
produced a contrary effect in Ireland itself, and was destined to be swept
away before a fresh wave of agitation.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_197" id="TOPIC_197"></a>A few days before the relief bill passed the house of commons an episode
occurred which is chiefly interesting for the light which it throws on the
ideas then prevalent in the highest society. In 1828 Wellington had
presided at a meeting for the establishment of King's College, London, an
institution which was to be entirely under the influence of the
established church, and which was intended as a counterpoise to the purely
secular institution which had been recently founded under the title of the
"London University". The Earl of Winchilsea, a peer of no personal
importance, but a stalwart upholder of Church and State, published in the
<i>Standard</i> newspaper of March 16, 1829, a virulent letter, describing the
whole transaction "as a blind to the protestant and high church party,"
and accusing the prime minister of insidious designs for the introduction
of popery in every department of the state. The duke at once sent Hardinge
with a note couched in moderate language, demanding an apology. Winchilsea
made no apology, but offered to express regret for having mistaken the
duke's motives, if the duke would declare that when he presided at the
meeting in question he was not contemplating any measure of catholic
relief. Whereupon the duke demanded "that satis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>faction which a gentleman
has a right to require, and which a gentleman never refuses to give". A
hostile meeting took place on March 21 in Battersea fields. The duke
intentionally fired wide, and Winchilsea, after discharging his weapon in
the air, tendered a written apology, in conformity with the so-called
rules of honour. The duke was conscious that his conduct must have
"shocked many good men," but he always maintained that it was the only
way, and proved an effectual way, of dispelling the atmosphere of calumny
in which he was surrounded. It is probable that he judged rightly of his
contemporaries, and that he gained rather than lost in reputation by an
act which, apart from its moral aspect, risked the success of a great
measure largely depending on the continuance of his own life. It may be
noticed that he afterwards became not only the personal friend of his
antagonist, but the most influential member of the Anti-Duelling
Association.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>EXCLUSION OF O'CONNELL.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_198" id="TOPIC_198"></a>Another episode, or rather sequel, of the great contest on catholic relief
had more serious political consequences. Though O'Connell was the
undoubted leader of the movement, and might almost have claimed to be the
father of the act, he was most unwisely but deliberately excluded from its
benefits. His exclusion was effected by a clause which rendered its
operation strictly prospective, for the very purpose of shutting out the
one catholic who had been elected under the old law. It had been decided
by a committee of the house of commons that he was duly returned, the only
question being whether he could take his seat without subscribing the oath
now abolished. This question was brought to a test by the appearance of
O'Connell in person in the house itself. The speaker, Charles
Manners-Sutton, declared that he could not properly be admitted to be
sworn under the new law, upon which O'Connell claimed a hearing. A long
and futile discussion followed as to whether he should be heard at the
table or at the bar. In the end he was heard at the bar, and produced a
very favourable impression upon his opponents as well as his friends by
the ingenuity of his arguments and the studied moderation of his tone. His
case, however, was manifestly untenable from a legal point of view, and a
new writ was ordered to be issued for the county of Clare.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span></p>

<p>Then was shown both the folly of stirring up so needlessly the inflammable
materials of Irish sedition and the futility of imagining that catholic
emancipation, right or wrong, would prove a healing measure. Having
exhibited the better side of his character in his speech before the house
of commons, O'Connell exhibited its worst side without stint or shame in
his addresses to the Irish peasantry. Skilfully avoiding the language of
sheer treason, he set no bounds to his coarse and outrageous vituperation
of the nation which had sacrificed even its conscience to appease Ireland;
nor did he shrink from denouncing Wellington and Peel as "those men who,
false to their own party, can never be true to us". The note which he
struck has never ceased to vibrate in the hearts of the excitable people
which he might have educated into loyal citizenship, and the spirit which
he evoked has been the evil genius of Ireland from his day to our own. He
openly unfurled the standard of repeal, but the repeal he demanded did not
involve the creation of an Irish republic. Ireland was still to be
connected with Great Britain by "the golden link of the crown," and though
agitation was carried to the verge of rebellion, the great agitator never
actually advised his dupes to rise in arms for a war of independence.
Short of this he did all in his power, and with too much success, to
inflame them with a malignant hatred of the sister country. If the
promoters of catholic emancipation had ever looked for any reward beyond
the inward satisfaction of having done a righteous act, they were speedily
and wofully undeceived.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<h3>PORTUGAL AND GREECE.</h3>


<p>It is now time to turn to the general course of foreign policy during the
closing years of the reign of George IV. The only foreign problems which
gave serious trouble during this period were the Eastern and Portuguese
questions. The influence which the former exercised on domestic policy has
rendered it necessary to trace its course as far as the battle of Navarino
in the last chapter. We must now take up the other question where we left
it, at the recognition of the independence of Brazil and the expulsion of
the Spanish troops from the mainland of America.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_199" id="TOPIC_199"></a>Peter I., Emperor of Brazil, though an independent sovereign, was still
heir-apparent to the throne of Portugal, and the ultra-royalists hoped
that, in spite of the provisions of the Brazilian constitution, his
succession to his ancestral crown would restore the unity of the
Portuguese dominions. The death of King John VI. on March 10, 1826,
brought the matter to a crisis. Four days before his death he had
appointed a council of regency which was to be presided over by his
daughter, Isabella Maria, but from which the queen and Dom Miguel, then
twenty-three, were both excluded. By this act the absolutist party were
deprived of power until they should be restored to it by the action of the
new king, or by a revolution. The regency wished the new king to make a
speedy choice between the two crowns; and it was anticipated that he would
abdicate the Portuguese crown in favour of his seven-year-old daughter,
Maria da Gloria. The absolutists on the other hand hoped that the king
might by procrastination avoid the separation of the crowns.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_200" id="TOPIC_200"></a>What was their surprise when they discovered that the king had indeed
determined to procrastinate, but in such a way as to displease the
absolutists as much as the friends of constitutional government? No sooner
had the news of his father's death reached Peter at Rio Janeiro, than he
issued a charter of 145 clauses, conferring a constitution on Portugal.
This constitution which was destined to alternate for nearly a generation
with absolute monarchy or with the revolutionary constitution of 1821, had
the advantage of being the voluntary gift of the king. It was, however,
composed in great haste, and, except that it retained the hereditary
nobility as a first chamber in the cortes, was almost identical with the
constitution established in Brazil in the previous December. Among other
provisions it subjected the nobility to taxation and asserted the
principle of religious toleration. A few days later, on the 2nd of May,
King Peter executed an act of abdication in favour of his daughter Maria,
providing, however, that the abdication should not come into effect until
the necessary oaths had been taken to the new constitution and until the
new queen should have been married to her uncle, Dom Miguel.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CIVIL WAR IN PORTUGAL.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_201" id="TOPIC_201"></a>This compromise pleased nobody. It is true that it seemed to make
permanent the separation of Brazil from Portugal, since the former state
was destined for Peter's infant son, afterwards Peter II.; but the
Brazilian patriots would have preferred a more definite abandonment of the
Portuguese throne, and Peter's half-measure of abdication was one of the
main causes of the discontent which drove him to resign the Brazilian
crown five years later. The Portuguese liberals were alarmed at the
prospect of a restoration of Dom Miguel to power, while the absolutists
were indignant at the imposition of a constitution. From the very first it
encountered opposition. The new constitution was indeed proclaimed on July
13, and the necessary oaths were taken on the 31st. But on the same day a
party, consisting mainly of Portuguese deserters in Spanish territory,
proclaimed Miguel as king and the queen-mother as regent during his
absence. Miguel, however, gave no open support to this party; on October 4
he actually took the oath to the new constitution, and on the 29th he
formally betrothed himself at Vienna to the future Queen of Portugal. But
the Portuguese insurgents were not deterred by the apparent defection<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span> of
the prince whose claim to reign they asserted, and they received a thinly
disguised encouragement from the Spanish government, which certainly did
nothing to interfere with their organisation in Spanish territory. On the
10th the last insurgents had been expelled from Portuguese territory, but
in November they were openly joined by some Spanish soldiers, and on the
22nd of that month they invaded the Portuguese province of Traz-os-Montes.
Another division made a simultaneous irruption into the province of
Alemtejo. This latter body was quickly expelled from the kingdom and
marched through Spanish territory to join its more successful comrades in
Northern Portugal. The whole province of Traz-os-Montes had fallen into
the hands of the absolutists in a few days, and its defection was followed
by that of the northern part of Beira, when the arrival of British forces
gave the constitutional party the necessary encouragement to enable them
to arrest the progress of the insurrection.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_202" id="TOPIC_202"></a>As in 1823, the Portuguese government, represented in London by Palmella,
applied for British assistance against the ultra-royalists at home. But on
the present occasion Portugal was able to appeal to something more than
the general friendship of Great Britain. By the treaties of 1661 and 1703,
renewed as recently as 1815, Great Britain was bound to defend Portugal
against invasion, and Portugal now claimed the fulfilment of these
treaties. The formal demand was received by the British ministry on
December 3, but it was not till Friday, the 8th, that official
intelligence was received of the invasion. Not a moment was lost in
despatching 5,000 troops to Portugal. This resolution was formed by the
cabinet on the 9th, approved by the king on the 10th, and communicated to
parliament on the 11th. On the evening of the 12th Canning was able to
inform the house of commons that the troops were already on the march for
embarkation.</p>

<p>The debate in the house of commons on the address in answer to the royal
message announcing the request of the Portuguese government, was the
occasion of two of the most famous speeches that Canning ever delivered.
After recounting the treaty obligations of this country to Portugal, and
the circumstances of the Portuguese application for assistance, and
disclaiming any desire to meddle with the domestic politics of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span> Portugal,
he referred to a previous anticipation that the next European war would be
one "not so much of armies as of opinions". "Not four years," he
proceeded, "have elapsed, and behold my apprehension realised! It is, to
be sure, within narrow limits that this war of opinion is at present
confined: but it is a war of opinion that Spain (whether as government or
as nation) is now waging against Portugal; it is a war which has commenced
in hatred of the new institutions of Portugal. How long is it reasonable
to expect that Portugal will abstain from retaliation? If into that war
this country shall be compelled to enter, we shall enter into it with a
sincere and anxious desire to mitigate rather than exasperate, and to
mingle only in the conflict of arms, not in the more fatal conflict of
opinions. But I much fear that this country (however earnestly she may
endeavour to avoid it) could not, in such case, avoid seeing ranked under
her banners all the restless and dissatisfied of any nation with which she
might come in conflict. It is the contemplation of this new power in any
future war which excites my most anxious apprehension. It is one thing to
have a giant's strength, but it would be another to use it like a giant.
The consciousness of such strength is undoubtedly a source of confidence
and security; but in the situation in which this country stands, our
business is not to seek opportunities of displaying it, but to content
ourselves with letting the professors of violent and exaggerated doctrines
on both sides feel that it is not their interests to convert an umpire
into an adversary."</p>

<p>In his reply at the close of the debate Canning vindicated his consistency
in resisting Spanish aggression upon Portugal, while offering no
resistance to the military occupation of Spain by France, which had not
yet terminated. He pointed out that the Spain of his day was quite
different from "the Spain within the limits of whose empire the sun never
set&mdash;the Spain 'with the Indies' that excited the jealousies and alarmed
the imaginations of our ancestors". He admitted that the entry of the
French into Spain was a disparagement to the pride of England, but he
thought it had been possible to obtain compensation without offering
resistance in Spain itself. Then came the famous passage: "If France
occupied Spain, was it necessary, in order to avoid the consequences of
that occupation, that we should blockade Cadiz? No. I looked another<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
way&mdash;I sought materials of compensation in another hemisphere.
Contemplating Spain, such as our ancestors had known her, I resolved that
if France had Spain, it should not be Spain 'with the Indies'. I called
the new world into existence to redress the balance of the old."<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>TROOPS SENT TO PORTUGAL.</i></div>

<p>The two speeches were greeted with applause both in parliament and in the
country, but their vanity was excessive. So far from "creating the new
world," Canning had merely recognised the existence of states which had
already won their own independence, and even so he was only following the
example of the United States. It was not only extremely foolish, but
altogether disingenuous, to maintain that the recognition of the South
American republics had been resolved on as a counterpoise to French
influence in Spain. The reasons which prompted this recognition were
commercial, not political, and it had been announced to the powers as our
ultimate policy before any invasion of Spain had taken place. The king had
only consented to the step on condition that it was not to be represented
as a measure of retaliation, and Canning himself when he delivered these
speeches knew that the French had promised to evacuate Spain in the
following April.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> But however little justified by facts, the two
speeches made a profound impression throughout Europe. Whatever Canning
might desire, it was quite clear that he contemplated the possibility of a
military alliance between this country and the revolutionary factions on
the continent, and the impression gained ground that he desired to pose as
the champion of liberalism against legitimate government.</p>

<p>The first detachment of the British army reached Lisbon on Christmas day.
It was not destined, however, to play an active part in the Portuguese
struggle. The insurgent army was as greatly discouraged as the loyal
troops were elated by its arrival, and the government was moreover enabled
to employ a larger force on the scene of hostilities. The insurgents were
in consequence driven out of the province of Beira and the greater part of
Traz-os-Montes. A new invasion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span> from Spanish territory, supported by some
Spanish soldiers and Spanish artillery, took place during January, 1827.
The greater part of the province of the Minho fell into the hands of the
rebels, and on February 2 they captured the important town of Braga. But
the forces of the regency proved too strong for them, and early in March
the insurgents evacuated Portugal altogether. The Spanish government, now
that little could be effected by further assistance to the Portuguese
refugees, determined at length to perform the duties of a neutral power,
and disarmed them.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_203" id="TOPIC_203"></a>The British troops remained in Portugal till March, 1828. By that time the
disturbances had assumed a purely domestic character, and it was
ultimately decided to recall them. But a firmer policy than that actually
followed would have been necessary in order to extricate Great Britain
from the strife of Portuguese factions, in which her recent action had
given a decided advantage to the constitutional party. That party had been
driven into opposition before the British troops were recalled. On July 3,
1827, King Peter had issued a decree appointing Dom Miguel his lieutenant,
and investing him with all the powers which belonged to him as king under
the charter. Miguel, after visiting London, arrived at Lisbon on February
22, 1828, and was sworn in as regent four days later. As he was
twenty-five years old, and therefore of full age according to Portuguese
law, he could not with any show of equity have been kept out of the
regency longer. Miguel's installation as regent was followed by a series
of riots as well on the part of the absolutists, who desired to make him
king, as on the part of the constitutionalists who feared that he would
make himself king. It was not long before he definitely identified himself
with the absolutist party.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>MIGUEL'S USURPATION.</i></div>

<p>On March 14 the cortes were dissolved. On May 3 Miguel summoned the
ancient cortes in his own name, and on June 26 they acknowledged him as
king. The immediate result of this act was that all the ambassadors,
except those of Spain and the Holy See, quitted Lisbon, and the lapse of
time did not induce them to change their attitude towards Miguel. A
further complication was introduced by Peter's definite abdication in
favour of his daughter on March 3, executed before he had any suspicion of
Miguel's designs, which placed Miguel in the position<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span> of regent for his
infant niece instead of for his brother. After this formal abdication
Peter despatched his daughter to Europe, intending that she should proceed
to Vienna. When, however, she arrived at Gibraltar on September 2, her
conductors, hearing of Miguel's usurpation, determined to take her to
England, and she landed at Falmouth on the 24th. Peter, on hearing of
Miguel's usurpation, naturally considered the regency terminated, and
claimed to act as the guardian of the infant queen; the Brazilian
ministers in Europe acted as his agents, while his partisans assembled in
England and attempted to use this country as a basis for warlike
operations in Portuguese territories.</p>

<p>The situation of 1826 was thus reversed. Instead of an ultra-royalist
party resting on Spain, a constitutionalist party resting on Brazil and
attempting to rest on England was now threatening the established
government at Lisbon. Wellington was anxious to maintain a strict
neutrality, but he failed to prevent a ship of war and supplies of arms
and ammunition going from Plymouth to Terceira in the Azores, where Donna
Maria was acknowledged as queen. He succeeded, however, in preventing a
larger armament, which had been raised under the name of the Emperor of
Brazil, with Rio Janeiro as its nominal destination, from landing at
Terceira. This action, though the logical consequence of the British
opposition to the conduct of Spain in 1826, was severely criticised in
England as equivalent to an intervention on behalf of Miguel.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_204" id="TOPIC_204"></a>Meanwhile Canning's attempt to prevent the separate action of Russia in
the Eastern question had been doomed to disappointment. The destruction of
the Turkish navy at Navarino was naturally regarded at Constantinople as
an outrage, and the Porte demanded satisfaction from the ambassadors of
the allied powers. This they refused to grant on the ground that the Turks
had been the aggressors, and they in their turn demanded an armistice
between the Turkish troops and the Greek insurgents. As the Porte remained
obdurate, the ambassadors of France, Great Britain, and Russia, acting in
accordance with their instructions, left Constantinople on December 8,
1827. But though war seemed imminent, the tsar still disowned all idea of
conquest, and professed to desire nothing further than the execution of
the treaty of London. A protocol was accordingly signed on the 12th by
which the three powers confirmed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span> a clause in the treaty, providing that,
in the event of war, none of them should derive any exclusive benefit,
either commercial or territorial.</p>

<p>The British government imagined that the powers might still effect their
object by diplomacy, and that it would not be necessary to abandon the
Turkish alliance. But any such idea must have been rudely shaken by the
hati-sherif of December 20. In that document the sultan enlarged on the
cruelty and perfidy of the Christian powers and summoned the Muslim
nations to arms: he denounced Russia in particular as the prime mover of
the Greek rebellion, the instigator of the other powers, and the
arch-enemy of Islam; and he declared the treaty of Akkerman, by which the
outstanding disputes between Russia and the Porte had been settled in
October, 1826, to have been extorted by force and only signed in order to
save time. This defiance of Russia, if not of all Christendom, was
followed by a levy of Turkish troops and the expulsion of most of the
Christian residents from Constantinople. No course was now open to Russia
but to make war. It remained to be seen whether any other power would join
her. On January 6, 1828, a Russian despatch announced the tsar's intention
of occupying the Danubian principalities, and suggested that France and
Great Britain should force the Dardanelles and thus compel the Porte to
comply with the provisions of the treaty of London.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>WELLINGTON'S EASTERN POLICY.</i></div>

<p>It is possible that if the direction of British foreign policy had
remained in the hands of Goderich and Dudley, our government might have
lent its support to a settlement of the Eastern question which would in
effect have been the work of Russia only. The more daring policy of
Canning, by which Great Britain had attempted to take the lead as
opportunity offered, either in active co-operation with Russia or in
active opposition to her, could only be directed by a more versatile
statesman than the nation now possessed. The accession to office of
Wellington, though it left Dudley at the foreign office, was really marked
by a return to the policy of Castlereagh, a policy which, if not
brilliant, was at least honourable, consistent, and considerate, and which
in the hands of Wellington was managed with a sufficient measure of
firmness, though with less tact and insight than had been shown by
Castlereagh. The first object of this policy was to keep the special
grievances of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span> Russia distinct from the complaints which Europe at large
or, in the present situation, the three allied powers were able to bring
against the Porte. By so doing the British government hoped to prevent
Russia from dragging other powers into a war for her private benefit, and
also to render it impossible for Russia to use her special grievances as a
lever by which she might effect a separate settlement of the general
question. For some years this policy was successful. Russia did indeed
wage a separate war with the Turks, but the Greek question was settled by
the three powers conjointly, and Great Britain rather than Russia took the
lead in the settlement. It was only after Palmerston had succeeded to the
direction of our foreign policy in 1830, that it was discovered how far
the victory of Russia in war had placed her in a position to dictate the
general policy of the Ottoman court.</p>

<p>Wellington experienced no difficulty in striking out a line of policy
along which he could carry France with him. On February 21 De la
Ferronays, who had been recalled from the French embassy at St. Petersburg
to occupy the post of foreign minister in the new liberal administration,
which had been formed in France in December, 1827, despatched a note
urging the immediate employment of energetic measures against the Porte.
He saw that the hati-sherif gave special occasion of war to Russia, and he
was naturally anxious to anticipate her isolated action by combined
measures of coercion. He had, however, nothing better to suggest than the
execution of the Russian proposals of January 6. Wellington, in his reply,
dated the 26th, rightly minimised the seriousness of the hati-sherif, and
characterised the proposed measures of coercion as destined to be
ineffectual. He also expressed the fear that if the three powers combined
to make war on the Turks there would be a general insurrection of the
subject races in the Turkish dominions which might last indefinitely. He
therefore proposed first to settle the Greek question by local pressure,
after which he anticipated no serious trouble about events at
Constantinople. On the same day he drafted a memorandum to the cabinet in
which he proposed that the allied squadrons should proceed to the
Archipelago, blockade the Morea and Alexandria, destroy the Greek pirates,
stop the warfare in Chios and Crete, and call upon the Greek government to
withdraw<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span> the forces which were operating in western and eastern Greece
respectively under the command of two foreign volunteers, General Church
and Colonel Fabvier. In other words, he proposed to coerce not the Porte
but the actual combatants, Greece and Egypt, and to check each party where
it was the aggressor. If the prime object of the government in the eastern
question was the maintenance of order, these proposals were excellent. The
one capital defect of the whole scheme was that it ignored the Russian
desire for war, which rendered it impossible for the tsar to postpone the
settlement of his own grievances until an arrangement should be come to on
the Greek question; on the other hand, by isolating the Greek question, it
left it possible for the western powers to proceed with its solution in
spite of the outbreak of hostilities between Russia and the Turks.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>WAR BETWEEN RUSSIA AND TURKEY.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_205" id="TOPIC_205"></a>Russia's determination to act singly was, however, already made. On the
same day, February 26, on which Wellington sketched his policy, Nesselrode
issued a despatch declaring that war was inevitable, including among his
reasons the repudiation of recent treaties by the Porte and the
proclamation by it of a holy war. At the same time he endeavoured to
disarm any possible opposition on the part of the powers by an invitation
to them to make use of the coming war to carry out the treaty of London.
In any case Russia would execute the treaty, but if she were left to
herself, the manner of execution would be determined by her own
convenience and interest.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> So far Russia had done nothing directly
inconsistent with the maintenance of her concert with France and Great
Britain, whose representatives had been sitting in conference with hers at
London since January, 1827. But the reference in this last note to the
possibility of a settlement of the Greek question according to the
convenience and interest of Russia appeared like a threat of breaking up
the alliance in case France and Great Britain refused to send their fleets
to the Mediterranean. At least Wellington so understood it, and, rather
than be a party to the war, he dissolved the conference of London in the
middle of March. But he soon found that by so doing he lost the
co-operation of France, and he was therefore compelled to accept the
assurances of Russia that she intended to keep within the limits of the
treaty of London, and to regard the Mediterranean as a neutral area.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span> The
conference was in consequence reopened at the beginning of July. Meanwhile
hostilities had actually begun between Russia and the Turks. Russia
declared war on April 26. On May 7 her troops crossed the Pruth. They
rapidly overran the Danubian provinces, and on June 7 crossed the Danube
into Bulgaria. They were destined, however, to spend more than a year
between the Danube and the Balkans before they could force their way into
Rumelia.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_206" id="TOPIC_206"></a>During the interval considerable progress was made with the settlement of
the Greek question. The treaty of London in providing for the autonomy of
Greece had specified no boundaries, and the first problem demanding the
attention of the powers that had assumed the task of the settlement of
Greece was to determine the limits within which that settlement was to be
effected. It might be urged that all the Greeks who had accepted the
armistice imposed by the powers in consequence of the treaty of London had
a right to share in the settlement at which that treaty aimed. But the
armistice had been broken by Greek attacks on Chios and Crete, and
Wellington held that the powers were, in consequence, free from any
obligation imposed by the nominal acceptance of the armistice. He,
accordingly, desired to adopt the simple principle of granting the
proposed autonomy to those parts of Greece in which the insurrection had
proved successful, namely, the Morea and the &AElig;gean Islands, and refusing
it in Northern and Central Greece, where the Turkish forces still held
their own. But the British cabinet was far from being unanimous; many,
among whom Palmerston was specially prominent, urged the concession of a
greatly increased territory. The changes which took place in the British
ministry towards the end of May, 1828, deprived Palmerston of his share in
its deliberations, and by substituting Aberdeen for Dudley at the foreign
office, placed our foreign relations under the direction of a man of
talent and experience, who had already exercised an important influence on
British policy and who was more in sympathy with the policy of the prime
minister than Dudley had been, but who was not content, like Dudley, to be
a mere cipher in the department over which he was called to preside.
Aberdeen, though opposed to the narrow boundaries which Wellington wished
to assign to liberated Greece, was no less antagonistic than his chief to
any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span> attempt to make the new Greek state politically important; and he was
even of opinion that the Russian declaration of war had released Great
Britain from any further obligation under the treaty of London.</p>

<p>Such were the composition and policy of the British government when the
conference of London reassembled in July. The differences between the
powers had prevented any active intervention in Greece, since the battle
of Navarino. The ports in the Morea, still occupied by Ibrahim, had indeed
been blockaded, but it had been found impossible to induce Austrian
vessels to acknowledge a blockade of such questionable legality, and the
allied fleets had even permitted the embarkation of Ibrahim's sick and
wounded together with 5,500 Greek prisoners, who were sold into slavery on
their arrival at Alexandria. The renewal of the concert of the three
powers was followed by a rapid change in the situation. On the 19th it was
decided that France should send an expedition to expel the Turco-Egyptian
troops from the Morea, while Great Britain should render her any naval
assistance that might be necessary. This step was valued by the British
government as definitely committing France to a share in the settlement of
the Greek question, and therefore interesting that power in opposition to
any attempt at a separate settlement by Russia. It also furnished a safe
outlet for French military ardour, disappointed by the results of the
Spanish expedition. In fact, the evacuation of Spain, which was in
progress at the date when this agreement was concluded, materially reduced
the strain which the new undertaking imposed upon the French government.
France immediately prepared to send out a force amounting to nearly 22,000
men. But before they could arrive, the greater part of their task had been
performed by other hands.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>TURKS EXPELLED FROM THE MOREA.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_207" id="TOPIC_207"></a>Codrington's conduct in permitting the embarkation of the Turkish sick and
wounded with their prisoners had given great dissatisfaction at home, and
the cabinet had resolved on his recall before the ministerial crisis of
the latter part of May. That crisis occasioned a fortnight's delay, and,
in consequence, Codrington was able, before his successor arrived, to make
a naval demonstration before Alexandria and on August 6 to obtain the
consent of Mehemet Ali to the following proposals: an exchange of
prisoners was to take place, involving the liberation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span> of the recently
enslaved Greeks, and the Egyptian army was to be withdrawn from the Morea,
but Ibrahim was to be allowed to leave behind 1,200 Egyptian troops to
help to garrison five fortresses which were held by the Turks. Before
either the new London protocol or the Alexandria convention could be
carried into effect, further differences had arisen. Russia had proclaimed
a blockade of the Dardanelles and ordered her admiral to carry it out.
This proceeding was regarded by the British government as a breach of
faith and a menace to British commerce. It was, however, impossible to
abandon co-operation with Russia for fear that the Greek question might
become involved in the issues at stake between her and the Porte.
Wellington, in consequence, contented himself with obtaining certain
exemptions from the operation of the blockade on behalf of British
subjects trading with Turkey, and with the exclusion of the Russian fleet
from the operations conducted in the Mediterranean in accordance with the
orders of the London conference. The French force for expelling the
Egyptians from the Morea arrived almost simultaneously with the Egyptian
transports for removing them. On October 5 Ibrahim set sail for Egypt,
with 21,000 men, leaving 1,200 behind in the five fortresses in accordance
with the terms settled at Alexandria. The French began their attack on the
remaining fortresses two days later, and by the end of November had
expelled all the Turks from the Morea. By the terms of their engagements,
they ought now to have departed. But it was hardly to be expected that
France would so readily abandon the advantage that the presence of her
troops gave her in the settlement of the eastern question.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_208" id="TOPIC_208"></a>Meanwhile the negotiations made slow progress. On November 16 a protocol
was issued placing the Morea with the neighbouring islands under the
guarantee of the powers. Wellington had opposed any extension of the
guarantee to Central Greece on the ground that the allies had to provide
both the necessary military force and the cost of maintaining the Greek
government, so that any undertaking beyond the Morea would involve heavy
expense without rendering lighter the task of maintaining order. But the
real decision of the question lay not with the diplomatists at London, but
with the diplomatists on the spot. Representatives of the three powers had
been sent to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span> Poros to make detailed arrangements in accordance with the
terms of the treaty of London. Stratford Canning, who represented Great
Britain, was one of the supporters of an extended frontier, and in the end
the ambassadors at Poros drew up a protocol in favour of erecting Greece
south of a line connecting the Gulfs of Arta and Volo into a hereditary
principality, which was also to include nearly all the islands. Even Samos
and Crete were recommended to the benevolent consideration of the courts.
All Mohammedans were to be expelled from this territory. The tribute
payable to Turkey was to be fixed at 1,500,000 piastres, but this was to
be paid not to the Turkish government, but to those who might suffer
pecuniary loss by the confiscation of lands hitherto owned by Mohammedans.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>PEACE OF ADRIANOPLE.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_209" id="TOPIC_209"></a>The spring of 1829 was marked by events which went far to cancel the
arguments on which Wellington had based his case for a restricted
frontier. Not only the north coast of the Gulf of Corinth but Acarnania
and &AElig;tolia were liberated by the Greek forces under Sir Richard Church the
castle of Vonitza falling on March 17, Karavasara shortly afterwards,
Lepanto on April 30, and Mesolongi on May 17.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> Meanwhile the terms
agreed upon at Poros had been adopted and further defined by the
conference at London on March 22. It was now provided that the future
hereditary prince was to be chosen by the three powers and the sultan
conjointly, and that the terms were to be offered to the Porte by the
British and French ambassadors in the name of the three powers; any
Turkish objections were to be weighed.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> It was not till June that
Robert Gordon and Guilleminot, representing Great Britain and France
respectively, were able to lay these proposals before the Porte, and it
was only after a Russian army under Diebitsch had crossed the Balkans that
the Porte on August 15 accepted them, and even then only with extensive
modifications. These limited the new state to the Morea and the adjacent
islands, and left the tribute assigned to the same purposes as before the
revolt; a limit was to be set to the military and naval forces of Greece,
and Greeks were not to be allowed to migrate from Turkish dominions to the
new state.</p>

<p>Wellington was of opinion that these concessions were ade<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>quate. He
attached great importance to the consent of the Porte, to dispense with
which seemed to him a sure method of encouraging a general revolt in the
Turkish dominions; and he also advocated a limited frontier in the
interests of the Ionian Islands. He doubted whether it would be found
possible to remove Capodistrias, who had been elected president of Greece
for a period of seven years on April 14, 1827, from his office to make
room for a hereditary prince, and he felt sure that if Capodistrias were
once granted Central Greece he would not hesitate to attempt the conquest
of the Ionian Islands. Capodistrias had in fact refused to accept any of
the arrangements proposed by the London conference, and was still engaged
in the vigorous prosecution of the war. Wellington did not, however,
succeed in inducing France and Russia to remain content with the Turkish
concessions. Diebitsch's successful march through Rumelia encouraged
Russia to demand more, and filled the minds of the French ministers with
the wildest schemes of aggression. They actually proposed to Russia that
the northern part of the Balkan peninsula should be divided between
Austria and Russia while the whole peninsula south of the Balkans, with
Bulgaria to the north, was to be formed into a new state under the
sovereignty of the King of the Netherlands, whose hereditary dominions
were in their turn to be divided between France, Great Britain, and
Prussia.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_210" id="TOPIC_210"></a>Such chimerical projects were based on the assumption that Constantinople
lay at the mercy of the army of Diebitsch; and this was believed to be the
case not only by the court of Paris, but by that of London, and even by
that of Constantinople. But no one knew better than Diebitsch how
precarious his situation was, and, if Russia wished to obtain advantageous
terms, it was necessary for her to make the most of the illusion while it
lasted. On September 14 the peace of Adrianople was signed, which
established the virtual independence of the principalities of Moldavia and
Wallachia and secured for all powers at peace with Turkey a free passage
for merchant ships through the Bosphorus and Dardanelles; Russia received
a small addition to her Asiatic territories, and Turkey accepted both the
treaty of London of July 6, 1827, and the protocol of London of March 22,
1829. The difficulties raised by Turkey's opposition to the full terms of
the protocol were thus swept aside, and it was now<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span> clear that, if that
protocol was to be further modified, it would be modified out of regard
for the interests of Europe not by way of concession to Turkey. France and
Great Britain were naturally averse from a settlement of the question by
Russia alone, even when that settlement was on lines to which they had
given their consent, and they might have been expected to propose some
alteration in the scheme. But the conciliatory action of Russia rendered
such proposals needless. On September 29, only fifteen days after the
treaty, Aberdeen received a formal proposal from Russia that Turkey should
be offered a restriction of the Greek boundary in return for a recognition
of the total independence of Greece.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> This proposal removed
Wellington's fear that the new principality might be used as a basis for
an attack on the Ionian Islands; while the maintenance of Turkish
suzerainty seemed less important after the apparent prostration of Turkish
military power in the recent war.</p>

<p>It now remained for the allied powers to select a prince to whom the new
crown should be offered. This subject engaged their attention from
October, 1829, to January, 1830. Finally, Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg,
widower of the Princess Charlotte, was selected, greatly to the annoyance
of King George IV. On February 3 Prince Leopold was formally offered the
sovereignty of Greece as an independent state, bounded on the north by a
line drawn from the mouth of the Aspropotamo to Thermopyl&aelig;. Before
accepting the crown he made an effort to obtain a stronger position for
its future prince. He asked for a complete guarantee of independence from
the three powers, some security for the Greek inhabitants of Crete and
Samos, an extension of the boundary to the north, and financial and
military support. The powers on February 20 decided to grant the guarantee
and a loan of &pound;2,400,000, and to allow the French troops to remain in
Greece for another year, but refused the extension of territory and would
not recognise the right of the Greek state to interfere in the affairs of
Crete and Samos. Leopold accepted the crown on these conditions on
February 24, and they were accepted by the Porte on April 24.
Capodistrias, who had no desire to make way for another<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span> ruler, invited
Leopold to the country, but suggested that he would not be well received
and that he would have to change his religion.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> These considerations,
combined with other causes, induced him to renounce the crown on May 21.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>FRANCE CONQUERS ALGERIA.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_211" id="TOPIC_211"></a>One other foreign event exercised the minds of Wellington's cabinet during
the last months of George IV.'s reign. This was the French punitive
expedition to Algiers, which resulted In the conquest of that state. The
expedition was originally planned in concert with Mehemet Ali of Egypt,
and appeared to Wellington to be prompted by the idea that the defeat of
the Turks by Russia afforded a convenient opportunity for a partition of
Turkish territory. The British government was able by means of diplomatic
pressure to induce Mehemet Ali to refrain from co-operating, but it could
not deny the justice of the French expedition or prevent it from sailing.</p>

<h3>PRELUDE OF REFORM.</h3>


<p><a name="TOPIC_212" id="TOPIC_212"></a>The year that elapsed between the prorogation of parliament on June 24,
1829, and the death of George IV., on June 26, 1830, was barren in events
of domestic importance. While Ireland was torn by faction, and the
Orangemen of Ulster rivalled in lawlessness the catholics of the other
provinces, England was undergoing another period of agricultural and
commercial depression. The harvest of 1829 was late and bad; the winter
that followed was the severest known for sixteen years; and a fresh series
of outrages was committed by the distressed operatives, especially by the
silk weavers in the east of London and the mill hands in the midland
counties. In the district of Huddersfield, where the people bore their
sufferings with admirable patience, a committee of masters stated as a
fact that "there were 13,000 individuals who had not more than twopence
half-penny a day to live on". When parliament met on February 4, 1830, the
prevailing distress was recognised in the king's speech, but in guarded
terms, and the ministers attributed it in the main, probably with justice,
to unavoidable causes. This gave the enemies of free trade and currency
reform an opportunity of renewing their protests against Peel's and
Huskisson's financial policy. They failed to effect their object, but
Goulburn, the chancellor of the exchequer, initiated a considerable
reduction of expenditure and remission of taxes. The excise duties on
beer, cider, and leather were now totally remitted, those on spirits being
somewhat increased. The government even deliberated on the proposal of a
property tax, and, stimulated by a motion of Sir James Graham, actually
carried out large savings in official salaries. On the whole, this session
was the most fruitful in economy since the conclusion of the peace. The
system of judicature, too, was subjected to a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span> salutary revision
throughout Great Britain by the amalgamation of the English and Welsh
benches, and the concentration of courts in Scotland. As the charter of
the East Indian Company was about to expire, a strong committee was
appointed to consider the whole subject of its territorial powers and
commercial privileges. This committee was not the least beneficial result
of a session which has left no great mark on the statute-book.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>MOVEMENT FOR REFORM.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_213" id="TOPIC_213"></a>The weakness of Wellington's position had long since become apparent to
all. By his conduct in regard to catholic emancipation he had estranged a
powerful section of his tory followers. By his jealousy and haughty
attitude towards his whig allies, he had forfeited their good-will, never
very heartily given. By his treatment of Huskisson, a small but able body
of politicians was thrown into the ranks of a discordant opposition. No
one else could have induced the king to give way on catholic emancipation,
but the king had not forgiven him, and submitted to him out of fear rather
than out of confidence. Though singularly deficient in rhetorical power,
he still maintained his ascendency in the house of lords by the aid of
more eloquent colleagues, but Peel was his only efficient lieutenant in
the house of commons. The vacancy in the office of lord privy seal,
occasioned by the transference of Ellenborough to the board of control,
had at last been filled in June, 1829, by the appointment of Lord Rosslyn,
nephew of the first earl, who, however, added nothing to the strength of
the ministry. In the meantime, reform had succeeded catholic emancipation
as the one burning question of politics, but with this all-important
difference that it roused enthusiasm in the popular mind. Political
unions, like the branches of the catholic association, were springing up
all over the country, and a series of motions was made in the house of
commons which feebly reflected the feverish agitation in all the active
centres of population. One of these, brought forward by the Marquis of
Blandford, who had made a similar motion in the previous year, was really
prompted by enmity against the author of catholic emancipation. Another,
introduced by Lord Howick, son of Earl Grey, called for some general and
comprehensive measure to remedy the admitted abuses of the electoral
system. A third, and far more practical, attempt was made by Lord John<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
Russell to obtain the enfranchisement of Manchester, Leeds, and
Birmingham. A fourth, and perfectly futile proposal, was made by
O'Connell, in the shape of a bill for triennial parliaments, universal
suffrage, and vote by ballot, to which Russell moved a statesmanlike
amendment, in favour of transferring members from petty boroughs to
counties and great unrepresented towns. All these motions were defeated by
larger or smaller majorities, but no one doubted that parliamentary reform
was inevitable, and few can have imagined that Wellington was either
willing or competent to grapple with it.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_214" id="TOPIC_214"></a>While domestic affairs were in this state, George IV. died. His
constitution, weakened by many years of self-indulgence, had been further
depressed by a growing sense of loneliness and by the long struggle with
his ministers over catholic emancipation. On April 15 his illness had been
made public, and on May 24 it had been necessary to bring in a bill,
authorising the use of a stamp, to be affixed in his presence in lieu of
the royal sign manual. A month later, the disease of the heart from which
he suffered took a fatal turn, and on June 26 he passed away, not without
dignity, in the sixty-eighth year of his age. Perhaps no other English
king has been so harshly judged by posterity, nor is it possible to acquit
him of moral vices which outweighed all his merits, considerable as they
were. The Duke of Wellington, who knew him as well as any man, declared
that he was a marvellous compound of virtues and defects, but that, on the
whole, the good elements preponderated. Peel, who had become by his
father's death Sir Robert, testified in Parliament that he "never
exercised, or wished to exercise, a prerogative of the crown, except for
the advantage of his people". These estimates assuredly err on the side of
charity, and are quite inconsistent with other statements of the duke
himself.</p>

<p>George IV., it is true, possessed many royal gifts. He was a man of no
ordinary ability, with a fine presence, courtly manners, various
accomplishments, and clear-sighted intelligence on every subject within
the sphere of his duties. But all these kingly qualities were marred by a
heartlessness which rendered him incapable of true love or friendship, and
a duplicity which made it impossible for him to retain the respect of his
ministers. His private life was not wholly unlike that of the Regent
Orl&eacute;ans<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span> and had much the same influence on the society of the metropolis.
He was an undutiful son, a bad husband, a perfidious friend, with little
sense of truth or honour, and destitute of that public spirit which atoned
for the political obstinacy of his father. No one sincerely regretted his
death, except the favourites who had been enriched by his extravagance,
and actually succeeded in carrying off a large booty out of the valuables
that he had amassed. Nevertheless, his regency is identified with a
glorious period in our military history, and his reign ushered in a new
age of reform and national prosperity. In the great struggle against
Napoleon and the pacification of Europe he gave his ministers a cordial
and effective support. To catholic emancipation he was honestly opposed,
but he kept his opposition within constitutional limits, and his intense
selfishness did not exclude a certain sentiment of philanthropy and even
of patriotism.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE ACCESSION OF WILLIAM IV.</i></div>

<p>His successor, William IV., was greatly inferior to him intellectually,
and infinitely less conversant with the business of state. Most of this
prince's early life was spent at sea, where he saw a fair share of
service, and became the friend of Nelson, but incurred his father's
displeasure by infringing the rules of discipline. Having been created
Duke of Clarence in 1789, he was rapidly promoted in the navy, but
remained on shore without employment for some forty years before his
accession, taking an occasional part in debates of the house of lords, and
generally acting with the whig party. During this long period he was
little regarded by his future subjects, and led a somewhat obscure life,
at first in the company of Mrs. Jordan, by whom he had a numerous family.
After his marriage with the Princess Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen in 1818,
he became a more important personage, and, as we have seen, was made lord
high admiral by Canning, but held office for little more than a year. He
was thus entirely destitute of political training, and was living in
privacy when he was called to ascend the throne on the eve of a singularly
momentous crisis.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_215" id="TOPIC_215"></a>The session was prolonged until July 23, when parliament was prorogued by
the new king in person, and on the following day a dissolution was
proclaimed, the writs being made returnable on September 14. During the
month that elapsed between the death of George IV. and the prorogation, no
serious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span> business was done, but the leaders of opposition in both houses
moved to provide for a regency, in view of a possible demise of the crown
before a fresh parliament could be assembled. This course was clearly
dictated by the highest expediency, for, had the king's life been cut
short suddenly, the young Princess Victoria, then eleven years old, would
have become sovereign with full powers, but without protection against the
baleful influence of her uncle, the Duke of Cumberland, the least
trustworthy person in the realm. In advocating it, however, the whigs
showed an evident disposition to win the favour of William IV., who had
never broken away, like his predecessor, from his whig connexion. These
motions were defeated, but the opposition gained popularity at the expense
of the government, by raising debates on certain state prosecutions for
libel, and on the question of colonial slavery. Their position was further
strengthened by a widespread impression that the king himself was a
reformer at heart, and would seize an early opportunity of declaring his
sentiments. His weakness had not yet disclosed itself, while his
kindliness earned him golden opinions, as he "walked in London streets
with his umbrella under his arm, and gave a frank and sailor-like greeting
to all old acquaintances".</p>

<p>The election of 1830, following close on the revolution of July in Paris,
was the death-blow of the old tory rule in England. The widespread
sympathy which the original uprising of 1789 had excited among Englishmen,
but which the atrocities of jacobinism had quenched, was now revived by
the comparatively bloodless victory of constitutional principles and the
accession of a citizen-king in France. The growing enthusiasm for reform,
thus stimulated, exercised a decisive effect in all the constituencies
except the pocket-boroughs. Brougham was returned without opposition for
Yorkshire, and Hume by a large majority for Middlesex, two brothers of Sir
Robert Peel lost their seats, and Croker was defeated for Dublin
University. Distrust of the government was equally shown in the counties
and in the great cities, but in some instances ultra-tories were elected,
in revenge for catholic emancipation or for alleged neglect of
agricultural interests. It was calculated that fifty seats, in all, had
changed hands, and the parliament which assembled in October 26 was very
different in constitution<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span> and temper from any of those which supported
tory ministries with unshaken constancy during the great war and the long
period of agitation consequent on the peace.</p>

<p>The losses of the government in Great Britain, partly due to its Irish
policy, were not compensated by any gain in Ireland, which did not fail to
display the ingratitude so often experienced by its benefactors. Catholic
emancipation was now treated as a vantage ground on which the battle of
repeal might be waged. Association after association was formed by
O'Connell, only to be put down by proclamation and to re-appear under
another name. The worst passions of the people were effectually roused,
assassinations became frequent, and Peel's correspondence with Hardinge,
then chief secretary, shows that he fully recognised the failure of his
experiment, as a cure for Irish anarchy.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> In the course of this new
agitation, O'Connell used most offensive expressions for which Hardinge
called him to account. The chief secretary's act may have been
unjustifiable, but the shuffling and faint-hearted conduct of O'Connell in
declining this and later challenges provoked by his foul language was
fatal to his reputation for courage. The most insolent of bullies, he
never failed to consult his own personal safety, by professing
conscientious objections to duelling, as well as by keeping just outside
the meshes of the criminal law.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE DEATH OF HUSKISSON.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_216" id="TOPIC_216"></a>A few weeks before parliament met a tragical accident closed the life of
Huskisson, whose death was rendered all the more impressive by its
circumstances. In 1825 the idea of railways for the rapid conveyance of
goods and passengers bore fruit in an act for the construction of a line
between Liverpool and Manchester. It was not in itself a new idea, for
tramways had long been in use, and so far back as 1814 George Stephenson
had constructed a locomotive engine for a colliery. But it was generally
believed that such engines must always be limited to a speed of a few
miles an hour, and even the great engineer, Telford, giving evidence
before a committee in 1825, did not venture to speak of a higher maximum
speed than fifteen or twenty miles an hour. Few indeed were far-sighted
enough to credit this estimate, and the incredulity of ignorance was
aided<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span> by the forces of self-interest, for the profits of canals,
stage-coaches, and carriers' vans were directly threatened by the
innovation of railways. However, George Stephenson quietly persevered, and
from the moment that his pioneer engine, the "Rocket," won the prize in a
great competition of locomotives, "the old modes of transit were changed
throughout the whole civilised world". On September 15, 1830, the first
public trial of this and other engines was made at the opening of the
Liverpool and Manchester railway. Wellington, Peel, and other eminent
personages were present, among whom was Huskisson, just returned for
Liverpool. Two trains proceeded towards Manchester on parallel lines, and
stopped at the Parkgate station. There several passengers got out, and
Huskisson was making his way to shake hands with the duke when he was
struck by a carriage of the other train, already in movement, fell upon
the rails, and was fatally crushed. He bore his sufferings with great
fortitude, but died during the night at a neighbouring vicarage to which
he was carried. He could ill be spared by his party, for, though he was
not the man to ride the storm which raged over the reform bill, his
counsels might have saved the whigs from the just reproach of financial
incapacity and have hastened the advent of free trade.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>WELLINGTON ON REFORM.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_217" id="TOPIC_217"></a>The winter session of 1830 opened with an ominous calm. It was believed
that private negotiations were going on between the ministry and the
survivors of Canning's following, which might result in a moderate scheme
of parliamentary reform. These expectations were utterly discomfited by
the king's speech delivered on November 2. It has unjustly been described
as "the most offensive that had been uttered by any monarch since the
revolution". On the contrary, it was tame and colourless for the most
part, recording his majesty's resolution to uphold treaties and enforce
order in the United Kingdom, but welcoming the new French monarchy in
terms which Grey emphatically commended. It gave offence to liberals by
describing the revolutionary movement in Belgium as a "revolt"; but what
called forth an immediate outburst of popular resentment was its
significant reticence on the subject of reform. This resentment was
aggravated tenfold by the Duke of Wellington's celebrated speech in the
lords, declaring against any reform whatever. The duke always refused to
admit that this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span> declaration was the cause of his subsequent fall, which
he attributed, by preference, to his adoption of catholic emancipation.
Speaking deliberately in reply to Grey, who had indicated reform as the
only true remedy for popular discontent, the duke stated that no measure
of reform yet proposed would, in his opinion, improve the representative
system then existing, which, he said, "answered all the good purposes of
legislation" to a greater degree than "any legislature in any country
whatever". He went further, and avowed his conviction not only that this
system "possessed the full and entire confidence of the country," but also
that no better system could be devised by the wit of man. Its special
virtue, according to him, consisted in the fact of its producing a
representative assembly which "contained a large body of the property of
the country, and in which the landed interests had a preponderating
influence". Finally, he protested that he would never bring forward a
reform measure himself, and that "he should always feel it his duty to
resist such measures when proposed by others".</p>

<p>There is no reason to suppose that the duke had consulted any of his
colleagues before making this declaration. Indeed, it is known that Peel
had just before received a confidential offer of co-operation in carrying
a moderate reform bill from Palmerston, Edward Stanley, grandson of the
Earl of Derby, Sir James Graham, and the Grants; nor had these overtures
been definitely rejected.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> Some lame attempts were made to clear the
cabinet, as a whole, from responsibility for their chief's outspoken
opinions, and Peel cautiously limited himself to a doubt whether any safe
measure of reform would satisfy the reformers. But he would not separate
himself from Wellington, and Wellington's ultimatum remained unretracted.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_218" id="TOPIC_218"></a>Brougham at once gave notice of his intention to bring forward the
question of parliamentary reform in a fortnight. In the meantime the duke
had committed a mistake which irritated the people, and especially the
inhabitants of London. It happened that the king and queen, with the
ministers, were engaged to dine with the lord mayor on November 9. Three
days earlier, the lord mayor-elect warned the prime minister that a riot
was apprehended on that occasion, that an attempt<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span> would probably be made
to assassinate him, and that it would be desirable to come attended by a
strong military guard. Upon this intimation, confirmed by others, the
cabinet most unwisely decided not to surround the mansion house with a
large armed force, but to put off the king's visit to the city. A panic
naturally ensued, consols fell three per cent. in an hour and a half, and
the disorderly classes achieved a victory without running the smallest
risk. There were local disturbances in the evening, and the duke arranged
to join Peel at the home office, in case decisive measures should be
required, but the new police were too strong for the mob, and the whole
affair passed off quietly, though not without involving the government in
some ridicule. The Marquis Wellesley, now in opposition to his brother,
declared the postponement of the dinner to be "the boldest act of
cowardice" within his knowledge.</p>

<p>If Wellington sought to conciliate the ultra-tories by his unfortunate
speech, he was soon undeceived. While Brougham's motion was pending, the
government proposed a revision of the civil list which purported to effect
slight economies for the benefit of the public. It was objected, however,
that a greater reduction of charges should have been contemplated, and
that parliament should have been invited to deal with the revenues derived
from the duchies of Cornwall and Lancaster, which, as Peel explained,
formed no part of those placed at the disposal of parliament. Sir Henry
Parnell moved to refer the civil list to a select committee; the
chancellor of the exchequer directly opposed the motion, and, after a
short discussion, a division was taken on November 15. The result, which
had been foreseen, was a majority of twenty-nine against the government in
a house of 437 members. There were many defections among the discontented
tories, and the Wellington ministry preferred to fall on an issue of minor
importance, rather than await a decisive contest on the reform question.
On the following day, therefore, both the duke and Peel announced the
acceptance of their resignations, and it was known that Grey had received
the king's command to form a new administration.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>GREY ACCEPTS OFFICE.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_219" id="TOPIC_219"></a>Grey was the inevitable head of any cabinet empowered to carry
parliamentary reform. His dignified presence, his stately eloquence, his
unblemished character, and his parliamentary experience, marked him out
for leadership, and disguised his want<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span> of practical acquaintance with the
middle and lower classes of his countrymen. His political career, ranging
over forty-four years, though not destitute of errors, had been perfectly
consistent. From the first he was a staunch adherent of Fox; he was among
the managers who conducted the prosecution of Warren Hastings; his
connexion with the Society of the Friends of the People, and his advocacy
of reform during Pitt's first administration are described in the
preceding volume of this history. On Pitt's death he became closely
associated with Grenville; it will be remembered that he joined his
short-lived government, originally as first lord of the admiralty, and
afterwards as Fox's successor at the foreign office. It was he who carried
through the house of commons the bill for the abolition of the slave
trade, and it may truly be said that, in opposition, he was equally
persistent in supporting every measure in favour of liberty, political or
commercial, and in resisting every measure, necessary or otherwise, which
could be interpreted as restricting it. We have seen how he more than once
declined overtures for a coalition with his opponents, and showed a bitter
personal antipathy to Canning, whom he was more than suspected of
despising as a brilliant plebeian adventurer. This suspicion of
aristocratic prejudice, ill harmonising with democratic principles, had
never been quite dispelled, and was now to be confirmed by the composition
of his own cabinet.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_220" id="TOPIC_220"></a>All the members of this cabinet, with four exceptions, sat in the house of
lords. No cabinet had contained so few commoners since the reconstruction
of Liverpool's ministry in 1822. Of the four who now sat in the house of
commons, Lord Althorp was heir-apparent to an earldom; Lord Palmerston was
an Irish peer; Graham was a baronet of great territorial influence;
Charles Grant was still a commoner, though he was afterwards raised to the
peerage. In the distribution of offices, full justice was done to
Canning's followers. Three of these occupied posts of the highest
importance, Palmerston at the foreign office, Lamb, who had succeeded his
father as Viscount Melbourne in 1828, at the home office, and Goderich at
the colonial office, while Grant became president of the board of control.
The selection of Graham as first lord of the admiralty did not escape
criticism, but was due to his tried energy in financial reform, and was
justified by the result. Lansdowne was made<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span> president of the council, and
Holland chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster. Both of these had been
Grey's colleagues in the administration of "All the Talents". Althorp, who
succeeded Goulburn at the exchequer, and Carlisle, who accepted a seat in
the cabinet without office, were both whigs of tried fidelity. But the
Duke of Richmond, the new postmaster-general, was a deserter from the tory
ranks, and Lord Durham, the premier's son-in-law, the new lord privy seal,
was a radical of the most aggressive type, well qualified, as the event
proved, to disturb the peace of any council to which he might be admitted.
Three occupants of places outside the cabinet remain to be mentioned. One
of these, the Marquis Wellesley, had been a warm supporter of catholic
emancipation when the Duke of Wellington stoutly opposed it, and his
brother's conversion on that question had not affected his own relations
with the whig party, which now welcomed him as lord steward. Lord John
Russell, the new paymaster of the forces, had identified himself as
prominently as Grey himself with the promotion of parliamentary reform,
and Stanley, the new chief secretary for Ireland, was probably selected
for his brilliant powers in debate, as the natural and most worthy
antagonist of the great demagogue, O'Connell.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>BROUGHAM BECOMES CHANCELLOR.</i></div>

<p>But the most formidable of all the "radical reformers" still remained to
be conciliated, and provided with a post which might satisfy his restless
ambition. At the end of 1830 Brougham was in the plenitude of his
marvellous powers, and in the zenith of his unique popularity. As member
for the great county of York, returned free of expense on the shoulders of
the people, he already occupied the foremost position among British
commoners, and it was feared that he might use it for his own purposes in
a dictatorial spirit. He had recently declared in Yorkshire that "nothing
on earth should ever tempt him to accept place," and that he was conscious
of the power to compel the execution of measures which, before that
democratic election, he could only "ventilate". So late as November 16, he
assured the house of commons that "no change in the administration could
by any possibility affect him," adding that he would bring forward his
motion for parliamentary reform on the 25th, whatever might then be the
state of affairs, and whatever ministers should then be in office. The
great whig peers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span> were most anxious to keep him out of the cabinet without
losing his support, or, still worse, provoking his active hostility. With
this view, Grey indiscreetly offered him the attorney-generalship, and we
cannot be surprised that Brougham rejected the offer with some indignation
and disdain. It was no secret that his supreme desire was to become master
of the rolls&mdash;an office compatible with a seat in the house of
commons&mdash;but his future colleagues well knew that, in that case, they
would be at his mercy in the house. Thereupon it was suggested, probably
by the king himself, that it might be the less of two dangers to entrust
him with the great seal, which Lord Lyndhurst was quite prepared to resume
under a fourth premier. Accordingly, it was known on November 20 that
Brougham was to be the whig lord chancellor, and on the 22nd he actually
took his place on the woolsack. His title was Baron Brougham and Vaux,
but, though he lived to retain it for nearly forty years, he always
preferred, with pardonable vanity, to sign his name as "Henry Brougham".</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_221" id="TOPIC_221"></a>Before the close of 1830 the new ministers found time to carry a regency
bill, whereby the Duchess of Kent (unless she married a foreigner) was to
be regent in the event of the Princess Victoria succeeding to the crown
during her minority. Having adopted the watchword of "Peace, Retrenchment,
and Reform," they gave an earnest of their zeal for retrenchment by
instituting a parliamentary inquiry into the possible reduction of
official salaries, including their own. The defeat of Stanley by "Orator"
Hunt at Preston was a warning against undue reliance on popular
confidence, for Preston was already a highly democratic constituency,
largely composed of ignorant "potwallopers". A similar but more emphatic
warning came from Ireland, where O'Connell did his utmost to insult and
defy Anglesey, the new lord-lieutenant, in spite of his sacrifices for
catholic emancipation, and his well-known sympathy with the cause of
reform. In the southern counties of England, too, violent disturbances had
broken out, and were marked by all the ferocity and terrorism
characteristic of luddism in the manufacturing districts. They spread from
Kent, Sussex, and Surrey into Hampshire, Wiltshire, Berkshire, and
Buckinghamshire. In these four counties there was a wanton and wholesale
destruction of agricultural machinery, of farm-buildings, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span> especially
of ricks, as if the misery of labourers could possibly be cured by
impoverishing their only employers. The rioters moved about in large
organised bodies, and their anarchical passions were deliberately inflamed
by the writings of unscrupulous men like Cobbett and Carlile.</p>

<p>Happily, the ministers showed no sign of the weakness upon which the
ringleaders had probably calculated. They promptly issued a proclamation
declaring their resolution to put down lawless outrage, and promised
effective support to the lords-lieutenant of the disturbed counties.
Acting upon this assurance, Wellington himself went down to Hampshire, and
took a leading part in quelling disorder. The government next appointed a
special commission, which tried many hundreds of prisoners and sentenced
the worst to death, though few were executed. This vigour soon overawed
the organised gangs which, in one or two instances, had only been
dispersed by military force. Finally, they prosecuted Carlile and Cobbett
for instigating the poor labourers to crime. The former was convicted at
the Old Bailey, and condemned to a long term of imprisonment, with a heavy
fine. The trial of Cobbett was postponed until the following July, when
the frenzy of reform was at its height. He defended himself with great
audacity in a speech of six hours, calling the lord chancellor with other
leading reformers as witnesses, and succeeded in escaping conviction by
the disagreement and discharge of the jury.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>ALTHORP'S FIRST BUDGET.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_222" id="TOPIC_222"></a>Two other questions engaged the attention of parliament on the eve of the
great struggle over the reform bill. One of these was the settlement of
the civil list, which the Duke of Wellington's ministry had failed to
effect. William IV. was not an avaricious sovereign, nor did he share the
spendthrift inclination of his brother. But he was disposed to stickle for
the hereditary rights of the crown, both public and private, and he
greatly disliked the details of his expenditure being scrutinised by a
parliamentary committee. Now, Grey and his colleagues stood pledged to
such a committee, and could not avoid promoting its appointment. They
propitiated the king, however, by excluding the revenues of the Duchy of
Lancaster from the inquiry, and ultimately succeeded in persuading the
house of commons to grant a civil list of &pound;510,000 a year. But the
publication of a return containing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span> a complete list of sinecure offices
and pensions was turned to good account by the economists, and produced an
outburst of public indignation, which was by no means unreasonable. Great
results were expected from the report of the select committee on the civil
list, which revised the salaries of officials in the royal household, as
well as the emoluments of pensioners. It was even demanded that no regard
should be paid to vested interests, but Grey firmly supported the private
remonstrances of the king against such an act of confiscation. In fact,
the savings recommended by the committee were so trifling that it was
thought better to waive the question for the time, and the first
economical essay of the new <i>r&eacute;gime</i> ended in failure.</p>

<p>The budget introduced by Althorp soon after the meeting of parliament on
February 3, 1831, and in anticipation of the reform bill, was equally
unsuccessful as a specimen of whig finance. Finding that, after all, he
could not effect a saving of more than one million on the national
expenditure, as reduced by his capable predecessor, Goulburn, he
nevertheless proposed to repeal the duties on coals, tallow candles,
printed cottons, and glass, as well as to diminish by one half the duties
on newspapers and tobacco. To meet the deficit thus created, he designed
an increase of the wine and timber duties, new taxation of raw cotton,
and, above all, a tax of ten shillings per cent. on all transfers of real
or funded property. This last proposal was at once denounced by Goulburn,
Peel, and Sugden, the late solicitor-general, as a breach of public faith
between the state and its creditors. Their protests were loudly echoed by
the city, and the obnoxious transfer duty was abandoned. The same fate
befell the proposed increase of the timber duties, and Althorp only
carried his budget after submitting to further modifications. Those who
had relied on his promises of economical reform were signally
disappointed, and, had not parliamentary reform overshadowed all other
issues, the credit of the government would have been rudely shaken in the
first session after its formation. But this great struggle, now to be
described, so engrossed the attention of the country, that little room was
left for the consideration of other interests, until it should be decided.</p>

<p>It is probable that no great measure was ever preceded by so thorough a
preparation of the public mind as the reform bills of 1831-32. Ever since
the early part of the eighteenth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span> century the abuses of the representative
system had been freely acknowledged, and no one attempted to defend them
in principle. The multitude of close boroughs, the smallness of the
electoral body, the sale of seats in parliament, the wide prevalence of
gross bribery, and the enormous expense of elections&mdash;these were notorious
evils which no one denied, though some palliated them, and few ventured to
assail them in earnest by drastic proposals, lest they should undermine
the constitution. So far back as 1770 Chatham had denounced them, and
predicted that unless parliament reformed itself from within before the
end of the century, it would be reformed "with a vengeance" from without.
In 1780 the Duke of Richmond had introduced a bill in favour of universal
suffrage, and Pitt had brought forward bills or motions in favour of
parliamentary reform as a private member in 1782 and 1783, and as prime
minister in 1785. But the French revolution persuaded him that the time
was not favourable to reform, and he successfully opposed Grey's motion
for referring a number of petitions in favour of reform to a committee in
1793.</p>

<p>After this, a strong reaction set in, and the reform question had little
interest for the governing classes during the continuance of the great
war. It was never allowed to sleep, however, and in 1809, a bill
introduced by Curwen to pave the way for reform by preventing the return
of members upon corrupt agreements, actually passed both houses, though in
so mutilated a form that it was practically a dead letter. Still, the
cause was indefatigably pleaded by Brand, and Burdett, who in 1819 made
himself the spokesman of the violent reform agitation then spreading over
the country. Unfortunately, this violence, and the extravagance of the
demands put forward by the democratic leaders, were themselves fatal
obstacles to a temperate consideration of the question, and threw back the
reform movement for several years. In 1821, when Grampound was
disfranchised, it assumed, as we have seen, a more constitutional form,
and motions in favour of reform were proposed by Russell in 1822, 1823,
and 1826, and by Blandford in 1829. Had Canning placed himself at the head
of the movement the course of domestic history during the reign of George
IV. might have been very different. As it was, the number of petitions in
favour of reform sensibly fell off in the last half of the reign,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span> and its
tory opponents vainly imagined that the movement had spent itself. We now
know that, in the absence of noisy demonstrations, it was really and
constantly gaining strength in the minds of thoughtful men until it
reached its climax at the end of 1830.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>PUBLIC OPINION AND REFORM.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_223" id="TOPIC_223"></a>The first act of the great political drama which occupied the next
eighteen months may be said to have opened with the fall of Wellington,
and the formation of the whig ministry. These events, together with the
success of the Paris revolution, supplied the motive power needed to
combine the great body of the middle classes with the proletariat in a
national crusade against the political privileges long exercised by a
powerful landed aristocracy. It is true that reform, unlike catholic
emancipation, had always appealed to broad popular sympathies, and had
been advocated by men like Grey and Burdett as carrying with it the
redress of all other grievances. But Canning was by no means the only
liberal statesman who heartily dreaded it, and even the advanced reformers
had not fully grasped the comprehensive meaning of the idea which they
embraced, or the far-reaching consequences involved in it. The palpable
anomaly of Old Sarum returning members to parliament, while Birmingham was
unrepresented, was shocking to common sense, and so was the monopoly of
the franchise by a handful of electors in some of the larger boroughs,
especially in Scotland. But few appreciated how seriously constitutional
liberty had been curtailed by the growth of these abuses (unchecked by the
Commonwealth) since the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, how
effectually home and foreign policy was controlled by a small circle of
noble families dominant in the lower as well as in the upper chamber, how
vast a transfer of sovereignty from class to class would inevitably be
wrought by a thorough reform bill, and how certainly men newly entrusted
with power would use it for their own advantage, whether or not that
should coincide with the advantage of the nation. Such general aspects of
the question are seldom noticed in the earlier debates upon it, and
economical reform sometimes appears to occupy a larger space than
parliamentary reform in the liberal statesmanship of the Georgian age.</p>

<p>With Wellington's declaration against any parliamentary reform, this
apathy vanished, and the movement, gathering<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span> up into itself all other
popular aspirations thenceforward filled the whole political horizon.
Reform unions sprang up everywhere, and instituted a most active
propaganda. So rapid was its spread and so wild the promises lavished by
radical demagogues, that Grey and his wiser colleagues soon felt
themselves further removed from their own extreme left wing than from the
moderate section of the conservatives. It is abundantly clear that Grey
himself, faithful as he was to reform, never dreamed of inaugurating a
reign of democracy. He often declared in private that such a bill as he
contemplated would prove, in its effect, an aristocratic measure, and he
doubtless believed that it would be possible to bring the new
constituencies and the new electoral bodies under the same conservative
influences which had been dominant for so many generations. He did not
foresee, as Palmerston did thirty years later, that, even if the political
actors remained the same, they "would play to the gallery" instead of to
the pit or boxes. He would, indeed, have repudiated the maxim: "Everything
for the people, and nothing by the people"; he was fully prepared to place
the house of commons in the hands of the people, or at least of the great
middle class, but he regarded the crown and the house of lords as almost
equal powers, and he never doubted that property and education would
practically continue to rule the government of the country.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>DRAFT OF THE FIRST BILL.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_224" id="TOPIC_224"></a>When the whigs came into office they were singularly fortunate in the high
character and consistency of their chief, no less than in the divisions of
their opponents, whose right wing showed almost as mutinous a spirit as
their own left wing. Even between Wellington and Peel there was a want of
cordial harmony and confidence, yet Peel was the only tory statesman of
eminent capacity in the house of commons. The attitude of the king, too,
was not only strictly constitutional but friendly, though it afterwards
appeared that he relied too implicitly on Grey and Althorp to protect him
against the machinations of the radicals. The letters written by his
orders, though mostly composed by his private secretary, Sir Herbert
Taylor, display marked ability together with a very shrewd and just
conception of the situation. His loyal adoption of a moderate reform
policy was a most important element of strength to his ministers at the
outset of their great enterprise, and, if he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span> afterwards held back, it was
in deference to scruples which several of them shared in their hearts. Nor
was the violence of the ultra-radicals, or the scurrilous language of
O'Connell by any means an unmixed source of weakness to men engaged in
framing and carrying a temperate reform bill. Their firm resistance to
extravagant demands reassured many a waverer and showed how carefully
their comprehensive plan had been matured. On the other hand, they had to
contend against difficulties not yet fully revealed. One of these was
their own want of administrative experience, contrasting unfavourably with
the statesmanlike capacity of Peel. Another was the intractable character
of two at least within their own innermost councils&mdash;Durham and Brougham.
A third was the inflexible conservatism of a great majority in the house
of lords, who, unlike the people at large, clearly understood that the
impending conflict was a life-and-death struggle for political supremacy
between themselves and the commons&mdash;the greatest that had been waged since
the revolutions of the seventeenth century.</p>

<p>It was privately known that a committee had been empowered to draft the
bill awaited with so much impatience. This committee consisted of two
members of the cabinet, Durham and Graham, together with two members of
the administration not of cabinet rank, the Earl of Bessborough's eldest
son, Lord Duncannon, then chief whip of the whig party, and Russell, who
was second to none as a staunch and judicious promoter of parliamentary
reform. In spite of his vanity and petulance, Durham deserves the credit
of having drawn up the report, highly appreciated by the king, upon which
the projected measure was founded. It originally included vote by ballot,
and it is rather strange that on this point Durham was powerfully
supported by Graham, but opposed by Russell. It is still more strange that
Brougham, whose scheme of reform was locked up in his own breast, was
honestly disturbed by the radicalism of his colleagues and specially
objected to so large a disfranchisement of boroughs as they contemplated.
Upon the whole, however, the bill was the product of an united cabinet,
and received the express approval of the king in all its essential
features. The elaborate letter which he addressed to Grey on February 4,
1831, betrays a sense of relief on finding that universal suffrage and the
ballot were not to be pressed upon him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span> In declaring that he never could
have given his consent to such revolutionary innovations, he insists
strongly on the necessity of maintaining an "equilibrium" between the
crown, the lords, and the commons, as well as between the "representation
of property" and that of numbers.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_225" id="TOPIC_225"></a>The reform bill of 1831, which differed only in detail from the act passed
in 1832, cannot be understood without some knowledge of the system which
that act transformed. This system has been well described as "combining
survivals from the middle ages with abuses of the prerogative in later
times". The counties remained as they had remained for centuries; Rutland,
for instance, returned as many representatives as Yorkshire, until in 1821
the two seats taken from Grampound were added to those already possessed
by Yorkshire. On the other hand, the old franchise of the 40s. freeholders
was more widely diffused since the value of money had been greatly
depreciated. Still, the influence of the great county families was almost
supreme, and they were firmly entrenched in the nomination boroughs, where
there was scarcely a pretence of free election. The crown had originally a
discretion in summoning members from boroughs, and used it by issuing
writs to all the wealthiest as better able to bear taxation and more
competent to sanction it. The poorer boroughs, too, were also glad to
escape representation in order to save the expense of their members'
wages. The discretionary power of the crown was afterwards used in
creating petty boroughs such as "the Cornish group," for the purpose of
packing the house of commons with crown nominees. This practice, however,
ceased in the reign of Charles II., and these petty boroughs fell by
degrees into the hands of great landowners, who dictated the choice of
representatives.</p>

<p>The result has been concisely stated as follows: "The majority of the
house of commons was elected by less than fifteen thousand persons.
Seventy members were returned by thirty-five places with scarcely any
voters at all; ninety members were returned by forty-six places with no
more than fifty voters; thirty-seven members by nineteen places with no
more than one hundred voters; fifty-two members by twenty-six places with
no more than two hundred voters. The local distribution of the
representation was flagrantly unfair.... Cornwall was a corrupt nest of
little boroughs whose vote outweighed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span> that of great and populous
districts. At Old Sarum a deserted site, at Gatton an ancient wall sent
two representatives to the house of commons. Eighty-four men actually
nominated one hundred and fifty-seven members for parliament. In addition
to these, one hundred and fifty members were returned on the
recommendation of seventy patrons, and thus one hundred and fifty-four
patrons returned three hundred and seven members."<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> Household suffrage
prevailed in a few boroughs, and here barefaced corruption was common.
Seats for boroughs, appropriately called "rotten," were frequently put up
to sale; otherwise, they were reserved for young favourites of the
proprietor. Neither yearly tenants, nor leaseholders, nor even
copyholders, had votes for counties. Of Scotland it is enough to say that
free voting had practically ceased to exist both in counties and in
boroughs, as the borough franchise was the monopoly of self-elected town
councils, and the county franchise of persons, often non-resident, who
happened to own "superiorities".</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>PROVISIONS OF THE FIRST BILL.</i></div>

<p>The reform bill of the whig ministry, drawn on broad and simple lines,
struck at the root of this system. Its twofold basis was a liberal
extension of the suffrage with a very large redistribution of seats. The
elective franchise in counties, hitherto confined to freeholders, was to
be conferred on &pound;10 copyholders and &pound;50 leaseholders; the borough
franchise was to exclude "scot and lot" voters, "potwallopers" and most
other survivals of antiquated electorates, but to include ratepaying &pound;10
householders. The qualification for this franchise had originally been
fixed at &pound;20, and the king deprecated any reduction, but the omission of
the ballot reconciled him and other timid reformers to an immense increase
in the lower class of borough voters. Sixty boroughs of less than 2,000
inhabitants, returning 119 members, were to be disfranchised altogether;
forty-seven others, with less than 4,000 inhabitants, were to be deprived
of one member, and Weymouth was to lose two out of the four members which
it returned in combination with the borough of Melcombe Regis. Fifty-five
new seats were allotted to the English counties, forty-two to the great
unrepresented towns, five to Scotland, three to Ireland, and one to Wales.
Altogether the numerical strength of the house of commons was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span> to be
reduced by sixty-two, and this entirely at the expense of England. Both
the county and borough franchises in Scotland were to be assimilated
generally to those established for England, and the &pound;10 borough franchise
was extended to Ireland. The bill contained many other provisions designed
to amend the practice of registration, the voting power of non-resident
electors, and the cumbrously expensive machinery of elections. It is
important to notice that it also limited the duration of each parliament
to five years&mdash;a concession to radicalism afterwards abandoned and never
since adopted.</p>

<p>On February 3 parliament met after the adjournment, and Grey stated that a
measure of reform had been framed, but the nature of it was not disclosed
to the house of commons until March 1, and during the interval the secret
was kept with great fidelity. The task of explaining it was entrusted to
Russell, whose thorough mastery of its letter and spirit fully justified
the choice, partly suggested by his aristocratic connexions and historical
name. His speech was remarkable for clearness and cogency rather than for
rhetorical brilliancy, and he was careful to rest his case on
constitutional equity and political expediency of the highest order rather
than on vague and abstract principles of popular rights. The debate on the
motion for leave to bring in the bill lasted seven nights, and was
vigorously sustained on both sides. The drastic and sweeping character of
the measure took the whole house by surprise, while its authors justly
claimed some credit for moderation in rejecting the radical demands of
universal suffrage, vote by ballot, and triennial, if not annual,
parliaments. Not only inside but outside the walls of St. Stephen's the
statement of the government had been awaited with the utmost impatience,
and it was universally felt that an issue had now been raised which hardly
admitted of compromise. The king himself, though much engrossed by minor
questions affecting the civil list and the pension list, heartily
congratulated Grey on the favourable reception and prospects of the
measure, which he regarded as a safeguard against more democratic schemes.
His great fear was of a collision between the two houses, and the sequel
proved that it was not unfounded. For the present, however, all promised
well. Peel denounced the bill with less than his usual caution, but
declined to give battle upon it, and it passed the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span> first reading on March
9 without a division. Indeed, the chief danger to the stability of the
government arose from its defeat on the timber duties. This and other
vexatious rebuffs so irritated Grey that he actually contemplated a
dissolution, lest the reform bill itself should meet with a like fate. But
the king would not hear of it, and the cabinet wisely decided to follow
the example of Pitt and ignore an adverse division on a merely financial
proposal, however significant of parliamentary feeling.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>SECOND READING OF THE FIRST BILL.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_226" id="TOPIC_226"></a>Between the 9th and the 21st, the date fixed for the second reading,
popular excitement rose to a formidable height. Monster meetings were held
in the great centres of population, and the political unions put forth all
their strength. Nevertheless, the efforts of the "borough-mongers" were
all but successful, and after only two nights debate the bill passed its
second reading by a bare majority of one, 302 voting for it, and 301
against it. After this demonstration of strength on the part of its
opponents, no one could expect that it would survive the ordeal of
discussion in committee, and a letter of Lord Durham, written in
anticipation of the event, sums up with great force the reasons for an
early dissolution. The crisis was precipitated by the action of General
Gascoyne, member for Liverpool, who moved before the house could go into
committee that in no case should the number of representatives from
England and Wales be diminished. In the hope of conciliating some wavering
members, the ministry framed certain modifications of their original
scheme, but they do not seem to have entertained the idea of accepting
Gascoyne's proposal in its entirety. In the division, which took place on
April 19, they were defeated by 299 votes to 291, and on the following
morning advised the king to dissolve. In spite of his former refusal, more
than once repeated, the king yielded to necessity, feeling that another
change of government, in the midst of European complications, and in
prospect of revolutionary agitation in the country, would be a greater
evil than a general election.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_227" id="TOPIC_227"></a>The opposition, flushed with victory, pressed its advantage to extremes,
and successfully resisted a motion for the grant of supplies. Urged by
Althorp, the cabinet promptly resolved on recommending that the
dissolution should be immediate, and the king, roused to energy by
indignation, eagerly adopted their recommendation. Indeed, on hearing that
Lord Wharn<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>cliffe intended to move in the house of lords for an address to
the crown against a dissolution, he strongly resented such an attempt to
interfere with his prerogative, and declared himself ready to start at
once and dissolve parliament in person. Difficulties being raised about
preparing the royal carriages in time, he cut them short by remarking that
he was prepared to go in a hackney-coach&mdash;a royal saying which spread like
wildfire over the country. Both houses were scenes of confusion and uproar
when he arrived, preceded by the usual discharges of artillery, which
excited the angry disputants to fury. Lord Mansfield, who was supporting
the motion for an address, continued speaking as the king entered, until
he was forcibly compelled to resume his seat. Even Peel was only
restrained by like means from disregarding the appearance of the usher of
the black rod who came to summon the commons from the bar of the house.
The king preserved his composure, and announced an immediate prorogation
of parliament with a view to its dissolution, and an appeal to the country
on the great question of reform. Such an appeal could only be made to
constituencies under threat of thorough reconstruction or total
extinction, but from this moment the ultimate issue ceased to be doubtful.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<h3>THE REFORM.</h3>


<p><a name="TOPIC_228" id="TOPIC_228"></a>The general election which took place in the summer of 1831 was perhaps
the most momentous on record. The news of the sudden dissolution, carrying
with it the assurance of the king's hearty assent to reform, stirred
popular enthusiasm to an intensity never equalled before or since. From
John o' Groat's to the Land's End a cry was raised of <i>The bill, the whole
bill, and nothing but the bill</i>. This cry signified more than appears on
the surface, and was not wholly one-sided in its application. No doubt it
was a passionate and defiant warning against any manipulation or dilution
of the bill in a reactionary sense, but it was also a distinct protest
against attempts by the extreme radicals to amend it in an opposite
direction. Now, as ever, the impulse was given by the middle classes, and
they were in no mood to imperil their own cause by revolutionary claims.
They could not always succeed, however, in checking the fury of the
populace, which had been taught to clamour for reform as the precursor of
a good time coming for the suffering and toiling masses of mankind. The
streets of London were illuminated, and the windows of those who omitted
to illuminate or were otherwise obnoxious were tumultuously demolished by
the mob, which did not even spare Apsley House, the town residence of the
Duke of Wellington. But, except in Scotland, no formidable riots occurred
for the present, and some good resulted from the new experience of popular
opinion gained by candidates even from unreformed constituencies hitherto
obedient to oligarchical influence, but animated for the moment by a
certain spirit of independence.</p>

<p>Having sanctioned the dissolution, the king addressed an elaborate letter
to Grey, in which he did not disguise his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span> own misgivings about the
perilous experiment of reform. Chiefly dreading a collision between the
two houses, he never ceased to press on his ministers the expediency of
making all possible sacrifices consistent with the spirit of the bill in
order to conciliate opposition in the house of peers. Grey's constant
reply was that no concessions would propitiate men bent on driving the
government from office, and that no measure less efficacious than that
already introduced would satisfy the just expectations of the people. Both
of these arguments were perfectly sound, and the constitutional triumph
ultimately achieved was largely due to the admirable tenacity of purpose
which refused to remodel the original reform bill in any essential respect
to please either the borough-mongers or the radicals. The elections were
conducted on the whole in good order. Seventy-six out of eighty-two
English county members (including the four Yorkshire members), and the
four members for the city of London, were pledged to vote for the bill.
Several notable anti-reformers were among the many county representatives
who failed to obtain re-election; even some of the doomed boroughs did not
venture to return anti-reformers; and the government found itself
supported by an immense nominal majority. The new bill, introduced on June
24 by Lord John Russell, who had recently been admitted in company with
Stanley to the cabinet, differed little from the old one. The number of
boroughs to be totally disfranchised was slightly greater, that of
boroughs to be partially disfranchised slightly less, but the net effect
of the disfranchising and enfranchising schedules was the same, and the
&pound;10 rental suffrage was retained. The measure was allowed to pass its
first reading after one night's discussion. The debates on the second
reading lasted three nights, but the bill passed this stage on July 8 by a
majority of 136 in a house of 598 members.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>SECOND REFORM BILL.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_229" id="TOPIC_229"></a>The victory, however, though great, was far indeed from proving decisive.
By adopting obstructive tactics, of a kind to be perfected in a later age,
the opposition succeeded in prolonging the discussion in committee over
forty nights, until September 7. Though Peel separated himself from the
old tories, and steadily declined to cabal with O'Connell's faction
against the government, such an unprofitable waste of time could not have
taken place without his tacit sanction. Only one important<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span> alteration was
made in the bill. This was the famous "Chandos clause," proposed by Lord
Chandos, son of the Duke of Buckingham, whereby the county suffrage was
extended to all tenants-at-will of &pound;50 rental and upwards. A very large
proportion of tenant farmers thus became county voters, and for the most
part followed the politics of their landlords. It may be doubted whether
Grey seriously lamented Chandos's intervention; at all events it went far
to verify his own prediction that aristocratic dominion would not be
undermined by reform.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> Meanwhile, the country was naturally impatient
of the vexatious delay, and a somewhat menacing conference took place
between the political unions of Birmingham, Manchester, and Glasgow.
Happily public attention was diverted to some extent by the coronation,
which took place on the 8th. The bill was carried more rapidly through its
later stages, and was finally passed in the house of commons on the 21st,
though by a reduced majority of 345 to 236.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_230" id="TOPIC_230"></a>On the following day the bill reached the house of lords and was set down
for its second reading on October 3. Thenceforth all the hopes and fears
of its friends and enemies were concentrated on the proceedings in that
house, whose ascendency in the state was at stake. The question: "What
will the lords do?" was asked all over the country with the deepest
anxiety. The debate lasted five nights, and is admitted to have been among
the finest reported in our parliamentary history. All the leading peers
took part in it, and several of them were roused by the occasion to
unwonted eloquence, but the palm was generally awarded to the speeches of
Grey, Harrowby, Brougham, and Lyndhurst. The first of these occupied a
position which gave increased weight to his counsels, since he was the
veteran advocate of reform and yet known to be a most loyal member of the
nobility which now stood on its trial. In his opening speech he appealed
earnestly to the bench of bishops, as disinterested parties and as
ministers of peace, not to set themselves against the almost unanimous
will of the people. Brougham's great oration on the last night of the
debate contained a masterly review of the whole question, and, in spite of
its theatrical conclusion, when he sank upon his knees, extorted the
admiration of his bitterest critics as a consummate exhibition of his
marvellous powers.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span></p>

<p>But very few of the peers were open to persuasion; the votes of
anti-reformers were mainly guided by a shortsighted conception of their
own interests, and Eldon did not shrink from contending that nomination
boroughs were in the nature of property rather than of trusts. A memorable
division ended in the rejection of the second reform bill on the 8th by
199 votes to 158. Twenty-one bishops voted against it. The king lost no
time in reminding Grey of his own warning against submitting the bill,
without serious modifications, to the judgment of the house of lords. He
also intimated beforehand that he could not consent to any such creation
of peers as would convert the minority into a majority. Grey at once
admitted that he could not ask for so high-handed an exercise of the royal
prerogative, and undertook to remain at his post, on condition of being
allowed to introduce a third reform bill as comprehensive as its
predecessor. Thereupon the king abandoned his intention of proroguing
parliament by commission, and came down in person to do so on the 20th
when he delivered a speech clearly indicating legislation on reform as the
work of the next session.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>REFORM BILL RIOTS.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_231" id="TOPIC_231"></a>During the interval between the 8th and the 20th it became evident that
the reform movement, quickened by the action of the upper house, would
rise to a dangerous height. A vote of confidence in the government,
brought forward by Lord Ebrington, eldest son of Earl Fortescue, was
carried by a majority of 131, and speeches were made in support of it
which encouraged, in the form of prediction, every kind of popular
agitation short of open violence. In the course of this debate Macaulay,
the future historian of the English revolution, delivered one of those
highly wrought orations which adorn the political literature of reform.
The excitement in London was great, but kept for the most part within
reasonable bounds, partly by the firm and sensible attitude of Melbourne
as home secretary. The mob, however, vented its rage in window breaking
and personal assaults on some prominent anti-reformers, one of whom, Lord
Londonderry, was knocked off his horse by a volley of stones. In the
provinces more serious disturbances broke out. At Derby the rioters
actually stormed the city jail, releasing the prisoners, and were only
repelled in their attack on the county jail by the fire of a military
force. At Nottingham they wreaked their vengeance on the Duke of Newcastle
by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span> burning down Nottingham Castle, which belonged to him, and were
proceeding to further outrages when they were overawed by a regiment of
hussars. A great open-air meeting of the political union was held at
Birmingham, while the bill was still before the house of lords, at which a
refusal to pay taxes was openly recommended in the last resort, and votes
of thanks were passed to Althorp and Russell. The former, in acknowledging
it, wisely condemned such lawless proceedings; the latter unwisely made
use of a phrase which gravely displeased the king: "It is impossible that
the whisper of faction should prevail against the voice of a nation". Both
were called to account in the house of commons for holding correspondence
with an illegal association, but disclaimed any recognition of the
Birmingham union as a body, and fully admitted the responsibility of the
government for the maintenance of order.</p>

<p>This assurance was about to be tested by the most atrocious outbreak which
disgraced the cause of reform. On Saturday, the 29th, Wetherell, as
recorder of Bristol, entered the city to open the commission on the
following Monday. Of all the anti-reformers, he was perhaps the most
vehement and unpopular, but his visit to Bristol was in discharge of an
official duty, and had been sanctioned expressly by the government.
Nevertheless, the cavalcade which escorted him was assailed by a furious
rabble on its way to the guildhall, and from the guildhall to the mansion
house, where he was to dine. For a while, they were kept back or driven
back by a large force of constables, but, on some of these being
withdrawn, their ferocity increased, and threatened a general assault on
the mansion house. In vain did the mayor address them and read the riot
act; they overpowered the constables, and carried the mansion house by
storm, the mayor and the magistrates escaping by the back premises, while
the recorder prudently left the city. At last the military were called
upon to act, and two troops of cavalry were ordered out. But the military
as well as the civil authorities showed a strange weakness and vacillation
in presence of an emergency only to be compared with the Lord George
Gordon riots of a by-gone generation. After making one charge and
dispersing the populace for the moment, the cavalry were sent back to
their barracks, and when one troop was recalled on the following (Sunday)
morning, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span> rioters were all but masters of the city. Many of them,
having plundered the cellars of the mansion house, were infuriated by
drink; they broke into the Bridewell, the new city jail, and the county
jail, set free the prisoners, and fired the buildings. They next proceeded
to burn down the mansion house, the bishop's palace, the custom-house, and
the excise-office. The cathedral is said to have been saved by the
resolute stand of a few volunteers hastily rallied by one of the
officials. In the midst of all this havoc, the cavalry were almost
passive, Colonel Brereton, the commanding officer, waiting for orders from
the magistrates, and actually withdrawing a part of his small force when
it was most needed, because it had incurred the special hatred of the
criminals.</p>

<p>On the morning of Monday, the guardians of law and order seemed to have
recovered their courage; at all events, the cavalry, no longer forbidden
to charge, and headed by Major Mackworth, soon cleared the streets, fresh
troops poured in, and the police made a number of arrests. The reign of
anarchy was at an end, having lasted three days. When a return of
casualties was made up, it showed that only twelve were known to have lost
their lives, besides ninety-four disabled, most of whom were the victims
of excessive drunkenness or of the flames kindled by themselves. But,
though the riot was quelled, it was some proof of its deliberate
promotion, and of the aims which its ringleaders had in view, that parties
of them issuing out from Bristol attempted to propagate sedition in
Somersetshire. A special commission sent down to Bristol condemned to
death several of the worst malefactors; four were hanged and eighty-eight
sentenced either to transportation or to lighter punishments; and Colonel
Brereton destroyed himself rather than face the verdict of a
court-martial.</p>

<p>On the same Monday, the 31st, Burdett took the chair at a meeting in
Lincoln's Inn Fields, called for the purpose of forming a "National
Political Union" in London. Soon afterwards, however, he retired from the
organisation, on the nominal ground that half of the seats on its council
were allotted to the working classes, but more probably because he was
beginning to be alarmed by the violence of his associates. His fears were
justified by a manifesto summoning a mass meeting of the working-classes
to assemble at White Conduit House<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span> on November 7, for the purpose of
ratifying a new and revolutionary bill of rights. This time the government
was on its guard, and Melbourne plainly informed a working-class
deputation that such a meeting would certainly be seditious, and perhaps
treasonable, in law. The plan was therefore abandoned, and soon afterwards
a royal proclamation was issued, declaring organised political
associations, assuming powers independent of the civil magistrates, to be
"unconstitutional and illegal". The political unions proposed to consider
themselves outside the scope of the proclamation, which had little visible
effect, though it was not without its value as proving that the government
was a champion of order as well as of liberty.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>NEGOTIATIONS WITH WAVERERS.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_232" id="TOPIC_232"></a>During the short recess of less than six weeks political discontent,
constantly growing, was aggravated by industrial distress and gloomy
forebodings of a mysterious pestilence, already known as cholera. A
voluminous correspondence was carried on between the king and Grey on the
means of silencing the political unions and smoothing the passage of a new
reform bill. It was not in the king's nature to conceal his own
conservative leanings, especially on the imaginary danger of increasing
the metropolitan constituencies, and Grey complained more than once of
these sentiments being confided, or at least becoming known, to opponents
of the government. At the same time attempts were being made not only by
the king himself, but also by peers of moderate views to arrange a
compromise which might save the honour of the government, and yet mitigate
the hostility of the tory majority in the upper house. In these
negotiations behind the scenes, Howley, Archbishop of Canterbury, and
Carr, Bishop of Worcester, took part, as representing the episcopal bench,
while Lords Harrowby and Wharncliffe, in temporary concert with Chandos,
professed to speak for the "waverers" among peers. As little of importance
resulted from their well-meant efforts, and as nearly all the supposed
"waverers," including the bishops, drifted into open opposition, it is the
less necessary to dwell at length on a very tedious chapter in the history
of parliamentary reform. Suffice it to say that when parliament
reassembled on December 6, 1831, the prospects of the forthcoming bill
were no brighter than in October, except so far as the danger of rejecting
it had become more apparent.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_233" id="TOPIC_233"></a>The final reform bill introduced by Lord John Russell on the 12th was
identical in its principle and its essential features with the former
ones. The chief alteration was the maintenance of the house of commons at
its full strength of 658 members. This enabled its framers not only to
reduce the number of wholly disfranchised boroughs (schedule A) from sixty
to fifty-six, and that of semi-disfranchised boroughs (schedule B) from
forty-six to thirty, but to assign a larger number of members to the
prosperous towns enfranchised. The bill was at once read a first time and
passed its second reading after two nights' debate on the 16th by a
majority of 324 to 162, or exactly two to one. But, after a short
adjournment for the Christmas holidays, a debate of twenty-two nights took
place in committee, and the opposition made skilful use of the many
vulnerable points in the new scheme. Every variation from the original
bill, even by way of concession, was subjected to minute criticism, and
especially the fact that the schedules were now framed, not on a scale of
population only, but on a mixed basis, partly resting on population,
partly on the number of inhabited houses, and partly on the local
contribution to assessed taxes.</p>

<p>It was easy to pick such a compound scale to pieces, to uphold the claims
of one venal borough against another equally venal, and even to reproach
the government with inconsistency in relying on the census of 1831,
instead of on that of 1821&mdash;a course which the opposition had specially
urged upon them. But it was not so easy to combat the irresistible
arguments in favour of the bill on its general merits, to ignore the
reasonable concessions on points of detail which it embodied, or to
explain away the patent fact that no measure less stringent would satisfy
the people. There was therefore an air of unreality about this debate,
spirited as it was, nor is it easy to understand what practical object
enlightened men like Peel could have sought in prolonging it. He well
knew, and admitted in private correspondence, that reform was inevitable;
he must have known that a sham reform would be a stimulus to revolutionary
agitation; yet he strove to mutilate the bill so that it might pass its
second reading in the house of lords, and there undergo such further
mutilation as would destroy its efficacy as a settlement of the question.
For the present he yielded. No attempt<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span> was made to obstruct the bill on
its third reading, when the division showed 355 votes to 239, and it
passed the commons on March 23 without any division.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE THIRD REFORM BILL.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_234" id="TOPIC_234"></a>Such a result would have been conclusive in any parliament during the
second half of the nineteenth century. A house of commons elected by the
old constituencies, and under the old franchises, had declared in favour
of a well-considered reform bill. The same constituencies voting under the
same franchises had returned an increased majority in support of the same,
or very nearly the same measure; this measure, with slight variations, had
been adopted by an immense preponderance of votes in the new house of
commons: yet its fate in the house of lords was very doubtful. Ever since
the autumn of 1831, the expedient of swamping the house of lords had been
seriously contemplated. It was supremely distasteful to the king, and Grey
himself, in common with a majority of the cabinet, was strongly averse
from it. Then came the intervention of Harrowby and Wharncliffe, the
failure of which strengthened the hands of the more determined reformers
in the cabinet, and induced the king to give way. Having already created a
few peers on the coronation, he consented to a limited addition in the
last resort, but with the reservation that eldest sons of existing peers
should be called up in the first instance, and upon the assurance that,
reform once carried, all further encroachments of the democracy should be
resisted by the government. He even authorised Grey to inform Harrowby
that he had given the prime minister this power, in the hope that it would
never be needed, and that at least the second reading of the bill would be
carried in the house of lords without it. His objection to a permanent
augmentation of the peerage remained unshaken, and Grey promised to
propose no augmentation at all before the second reading.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_235" id="TOPIC_235"></a>This compact, if it can be so called, was fulfilled in the letter, for the
bill was read a first time without a division, and it passed the second
reading on April 14 by a majority of 184 to 175. To all appearance a
notable process of conversion had been wrought among the peers, seventeen
of whom actually changed sides, while ten opponents of the former bill
absented themselves, and twelve new adherents were gained. However
encouraging these figures might be, the ministers were under no illusion.
They had the best reason for expecting the worst<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span> from the struggle in
committee, and they were conscious of gradually losing the king's
confidence. The very demonstrations of popular enthusiasm for reform which
impressed others with a sense of its necessity impressed him with a sense
of its danger; the political unions and the Bristol riots alarmed him
extremely; and the foreign policy of the government elicited from him so
outspoken a protest that Grey tendered his resignation. The difficulty was
overcome for the moment, but recurred in a more serious form when
parliament reassembled on May 7. Lyndhurst at once proposed in committee
to postpone the consideration of schedule A; in other words, to shelve the
most vital provisions of the bill until the rest should have been
dissected in a hostile spirit. This proposal is supposed to have been
concerted with Harrowby and Wharncliffe, if not to have received the
sanction of the Duke of Wellington. It was adopted by 151 votes to 116,
and the cabinet, on May 8, courageously determined to make a decisive
stand. They firmly advised the king to confer peerages on "such a number
of persons as might ensure the success of the bill". The principle thus
expressed had, as has been seen, been reluctantly approved by the king
himself, but he recoiled from the application of it when he learned that
it would involve at least fifty new creations. After a day's thought, he
closed with the only alternative, and accepted the resignation of his
ministry. He then sent for Lyndhurst, who of course at once communicated
with the duke.</p>

<p>The king, as we have seen, had never been able to understand the real
force of the reform movement, and his leading idea was that the demand for
reform might be satisfied by a moderate reform bill, which the house of
lords would not reject or reduce to nullity. Wellington shared this
impression, and, though an implacable opponent of reform, was willing to
undertake office for the purpose of carrying, not merely a mild substitute
for the whig reform bill, but the whig reform bill itself with little
modification. Such an act might appear immoral in a statesman whose
integrity was more open to question, but the duke's political <i>moral</i>
appears to have been of a less delicate type than that which is commonly
expected in party politicians. As a general, he considered, first of all
and above all, what man&oelig;uvres would best advance his plan of campaign.
As a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span> political leader, he regarded himself not as the chief of a party,
still less as the exponent of a creed, but rather as a public servant to
whom his followers owed allegiance, whether in office or in opposition. As
a public servant he felt bound to obey the king's summons, and conduct the
administration, honestly and efficiently, but without much concern for
personal convictions. He was also anxious to preserve the house of lords
from being swamped and so rendered ridiculous by an extensive creation of
peers.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>ATTEMPTS TO FORM A TORY MINISTRY.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_236" id="TOPIC_236"></a>But Wellington knew that he was powerless to manage the house of commons
without the aid of Peel, and Peel, though pliable in the case of catholic
emancipation, was inflexible in the case of reform. He drew a distinction
between these cases, and absolutely rejected the advice of Croker that he
should grasp the helm of state to avert the worse evil of the whigs being
recalled. "I look," he wrote, "beyond the exigency and the peril of the
present moment, and I do believe that one of the greatest calamities that
could befall the country would be the utter want of confidence in the
declarations of public men which must follow the adoption of the bill of
reform by me as a minister of the crown."<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> This language, repeated
under reserve in the house of commons, after a direct appeal from the
king, strongly contrasts with that of the duke who roundly asserted that
he should have been ashamed to show his face in the streets if he had
refused to serve his sovereign in an emergency. The marked divergence of
views and conduct between the two leaders of the conservative party led to
a temporary estrangement which materially weakened their counsels, and was
not finally removed until a fresh crisis arose two years later.</p>

<p>While Lyndhurst and the duke were vainly endeavouring to patch up a
government without Peel or his personal adherents, Goulburn and Croker,
the house of commons and the country gave decisive proofs of their
resolution. A vote of confidence in Grey's ministry, proposed by
Ebrington, was carried on May 10 by a majority of eighty. Petitions came
in from the city of London and Manchester, calling upon the commons to
stop the supplies, and the reckless populace clamoured for a run upon the
Bank of England. A mass meeting convened by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span> Birmingham political
union had already hoisted the standard of revolt against the legislature,
unless it would comply with the will of the people; the example was
spreading rapidly, and events seemed to be hurrying on towards a
fulfilment of Russell's prediction that, in the event of a political
deadlock, the British constitution would perish in the conflict. The duke
was credited, of course unjustly, with the intention of establishing
military rule, and doubts were freely expressed whether he could rely
either on the army or on the police to put down insurgent mobs. The
excitement in the house of commons itself was scarcely less formidable,
and it soon became evident that high tories were almost as much incensed
by the prospect of a tory reform bill as radicals and whigs by the vote on
Lyndhurst's amendment.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_237" id="TOPIC_237"></a>On the 14th Manners Sutton and Alexander Baring, Lyndhurst's trusted
confidants, plainly informed the duke that his self-imposed task was
hopeless, and on the next day the duke advised the king to recall Grey.
The king, who had apparently grasped the position earlier, acquiesced in
this solution of the question. He agreed to recall Grey and his
colleagues, and to use his own personal influence in persuading tory peers
to abstain from voting. He attempted to impose upon his old ministers the
condition of modifying the bill considerably, but they continued to insist
on maintaining its integrity, and on swamping the upper house, unless its
opposition should be withdrawn. It was, happily, unnecessary to resort to
such extreme measures. A letter from the king, dated the 17th, informed
Wellington that all difficulties would be removed by "a declaration in the
house of lords from a sufficient number of peers that they have come to
the resolution of dropping their further opposition to the reform bill".
On that night, after stating what had passed, the duke retired from the
house, followed by about 100 peers, and absented himself from the
discussion of the bill in committee. A stalwart minority remained, and
took issue on a few clauses, but their numbers constantly dwindled, and
when the report was received on June 1 only eighteen peers recorded their
dissent in a protest. <a name="TOPIC_238" id="TOPIC_238"></a>Grey himself, though suffering from illness, moved
the third reading on the 4th, when it was carried by 106 to 22. His last
words did not lack the dignity which had marked his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span> bearing throughout,
and expressed the earnest hope that, in spite of sinister forebodings,
"the measure would be found to be, in the best sense, conservative of the
constitution".</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>ROYAL ASSENT TO THE BILL.</i></div>

<p>The amendments made in the house of lords were slight, and the house of
commons adopted them without any argument on their merits. Peel, who had
made a convincing defence of his recent conduct, and who afterwards took a
statesmanlike course in the reformed parliament, declared, with some
petulance, that he would have nothing to do with the consideration of
provisions or amendments passed under compulsion, and that he was prepared
to accept them, <i>en bloc</i>, whatever their nature or consequences. The
bill, therefore, received the royal assent on the 7th, but the king could
not be induced to perform this ceremony in person. Though his scruples had
been respected in framing the scheme of reform, though he was consulted at
every turn and clearly recognised the necessity to which he bowed, and
though he was spared the resort to a <i>coup d'&eacute;tat</i> which he abhorred, he
could not but feel humiliated by the ill-disguised subjection of the crown
and the nobility to a single chamber of the people. It is greatly to his
honour that, with limited intelligence, and strong prejudices, he should
have played a straightforward and strictly constitutional part in so
perilous a crisis.</p>

<p>By the great reform bill, as it was still called even after it became an
act, the whole representative system of England and Wales was
reconstructed. Fifty-six nomination boroughs, as we have seen, lost their
members altogether; thirty more were reduced to one member, and Weymouth
which, coupled with Melcombe Regis, had returned four members, now lost
two. Twenty-two large towns, including metropolitan districts, were
allotted two members each; twenty smaller but considerable towns received
one member each; the number of English and Welsh county members was
increased from ninety-four to one hundred and fifty-nine, and the larger
counties were parcelled out into divisions. All the fanciful and
antiquated franchises which had prevailed in the older boroughs were swept
away to make room for a levelling &pound;10 household suffrage, the privileges
of freemen being alone preserved. The rights of 40s. freeholders were
retained in counties, but they found themselves associated with a large
body of copyholders, leaseholders, and tenants-at-will pay<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>ing &pound;50 in
rent. The general result was to place the borough representation mainly in
the hands of shopkeepers, and the county representation mainly in those of
landlords and farmers. The former change had a far greater effect on the
balance of parties than the latter. The shopkeepers, of whom many were
nonconformists, long continued to cherish advanced radical traditions,
partly derived from the reform agitation, and constantly rebelled against
dictation from their rich customers. The farmers, dependent on their
landlords and closely allied with them in defending the corn laws, proved
more submissive to influence, and constituted the backbone of the great
agricultural interest.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_239" id="TOPIC_239"></a>The enactment of the English reform bill carried with it as its necessary
sequel the success of similar bills for Scotland and Ireland. In Scotland
electoral abuses were so gross that reform was comparatively simple, and
that proposed, as Jeffrey, the lord advocate, frankly said, "left not a
shred of the former system". The nation, as a whole, gained eight members,
since its total representation was raised from forty-five to fifty-three
seats, thirty for counties and twenty-three for cities and burghs. Two
members were allotted to Edinburgh and Glasgow respectively; one each to
Paisley, Aberdeen, Perth, Dundee, and Greenock, as well as to certain
groups of boroughs. Both the county and burgh electorates were entirely
transformed. The "old parchment freeholders" in counties, many of whom
owned not a foot of land, were superseded by a mixed body of freeholders
and leaseholders with real though various qualifications. The electoral
monopoly of town councils was replaced by the enfranchisement of
householders with a uniform qualification of &pound;10. A claim to
representation on behalf of the Scottish universities was negatived in the
house of lords. The number of representatives for Ireland was raised from
100 to 105. The disfranchisement of the 40s. freeholders was maintained
against the strenuous attacks of O'Connell and Sheil, but the introduction
of the &pound;10 borough franchise amply balanced the loss of democratic
influence in counties. On the whole the transfer of power from class to
class was greater in Scotland and Ireland than in England itself, and in
Ireland this signified a corresponding transfer of power from protestants
to catholics. The rule of the priests was almost as absolute as ever until
it was checked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span> for a while by a purely democratic movement, and the Irish
vote in the house of commons was generally cast on the radical side.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>RETROSPECT OF THE REFORM MOVEMENT.</i></div>

<p>A calm retrospect of the reform movement, culminating in the acts of 1832,
compels us to see how little the course of politics is guided by reason,
and how much by circumstances. Every argument employed in that and the
preceding year possessed equal force at the end of the eighteenth century,
and the benefits of reform might have been obtained at a much smaller cost
of domestic strife; nor can we doubt that, but for the French revolution,
these arguments would have prevailed. Whether or not the sanguinary
disruption of French society furthered the cause of progress on the
continent, it assuredly threw back that cause in Great Britain for more
than a generation. Not only did its horrors and enormities produce a
reaction which paralysed the efforts of liberals in this country, but the
wars arising out of it engrossed for twenty years the whole energy of the
nation. Had it been possible for Pitt to pass a reform bill after carrying
the Irish union, the current of English history would have been strangely
diverted. The sublime tenacity of that proud aristocracy which defied the
French empire in arms, and nerved all the rest of Europe by its example
and its subsidies, would never have been exhibited by a democratic or
middle class parliament, and it is more than probable that Great Britain
would have stood neutral while the continent was enslaved or worked out
its own salvation. On the other hand, in such a case, Great Britain might
have been spared a great part of the misery and discontent which,
following the peace, but indirectly caused by the war, actually paved the
way for the reform movement. It remained for a second French revolution,
combined with the infatuation of English tories, to supply the motive
power which converted a party cry into a national demand for justice. The
reform act was, in truth, a completion of the earlier English revolution
provoked by the Stuarts. Considering the condition of the people before
its introduction, and the obstinacy of the resistance to be overborne, we
may well marvel that it was carried, after all, so peacefully, and must
ever remember it as a signal triumph of whig statesmanship.</p>

<p>It was the crowning merit of the reform act, from a whig point of view,
that it stayed the rising tide of democracy, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span> raised a barrier against
household suffrage and the ballot which was not broken down for a
generation more. It put an end to an oligarchy of borough-owners and
borough-mongers; it was a charter of political rights for the
manufacturing interest and the great middle class. But it did nothing for
the working classes in town or country; indeed, by the abolition of
potwallopers and scot-and-lot voters in a few boroughs, they forfeited
such fragmentary representation as they had possessed. Hence the seeds of
chartism, already sown, were quickened in 1832; but socialism was not yet
a force in politics, and it was still hoped that, under the new electoral
system, the sufferings of the poor might be mostly remedied by act of
parliament. The effect of the reform act on the balance of the
constitution was not, at first, fully appreciated. The grievance of
nomination-boroughs had been all but completely redressed, and that of
political corruption greatly diminished, but the hereditary peerage
remained, and the right of the lords to override the will of the commons
had ostensibly survived the conflict of 1831-32. But far-sighted men could
not fail to perceive that, in fact, the upper house was no longer a
co-ordinate estate of the realm. The peers retained an indefinite power of
delaying a measure, but it soon came to be a received maxim that on a
measure of primary importance such a power could only be exercised in
order to give the commons an opportunity of reconsideration or to force an
appeal to the country at a general election, and that a new house of
commons, armed with a mandate to carry that measure, though once rejected
by the peers, could not be resisted except at the risk of revolution.</p>

<p>The best safeguard against collision, however, was to be found in the
latent conservatism of the house of commons itself. Reformed as it was, it
had not ceased to be mainly a house of country gentlemen, and the
non-payment of members was a security for its being composed, almost
exclusively, of men with independent means and a stake in the country. A
very large proportion of these had been educated at the great public
schools, or the old English universities. They might accept on the
hustings the doctrine, against which Burke so eloquently protested, that a
representative is above all a delegate, and must go to parliament as the
pledged mouthpiece of his constituency. But in the house itself they could
not divest themselves of the senti<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>ments derived from their birth, their
education, and their own personal interests; nor was it found impossible,
without a direct violation of pledges, to act upon their own opinions in
many a critical division. Still, it has been well pointed out that, with
the flowing tide of reform there arose a new and one-sided conception of
statesmanship as consisting in progressive amendment of the laws rather
than in efficient administration, so that it is now popularly regarded as
a mark of weakness on the part of any government to allow a session to
pass without effecting some important legislative change.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CORONATION OF WILLIAM IV.</i></div>

<p>The supreme interest of the reform bill and its incidents naturally
dwarfed all other political questions, and the legislative annals of
1831-32 are otherwise singularly devoid of historical importance. The
coronation of William IV., which, as has been seen, took place on
September 8, 1831, was hardly more than an interlude in the great
struggle, yet it served for the moment to assuage the animosities of party
warfare. The king himself, who disliked solemn ceremonials, and the
ministers, deeply pledged to economy, were inclined to dispense with the
pageant altogether. It was found, however, that not only peers and court
officials but the public would be grievously disappointed by the omission
of what, after all, is a solemn public celebration of the compact between
the sovereign and the nation. The coronation was, therefore, carried out
with due pomp and all the time-honoured formalities, but without the
profuse extravagance which attended the enthronement of George IV. There
was no public banquet, and the public celebration ceased with the ceremony
in Westminster Abbey. The Duke of Wellington and other leading members of
the opposition had been duly consulted by the government; there was a
welcome respite from parliamentary warfare; the king's returning
popularity was confirmed; and all classes of the people were satisfied.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE CHOLERA EPIDEMIC.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_240" id="TOPIC_240"></a>Two months later, the appearance of the cholera at Sunderland added
another grave cause of anxiety to all the difficulties created by the
defeat of the reform bill in the house of lords, and the ominous riots at
Bristol. A similar but distinct and infinitely milder disease had long
been known under the name of <i>cholera morbus</i>, or more correctly <i>cholera
nostras</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span> Asiatic cholera, as the new disease was called, had no affinity
with any other known disease, and excited all the greater terror by its
novelty, as well as by the suddenness of its fatal effect. It was first
observed by English physicians in 1817, when 10,000 persons fell victims
to it in the district of Jessor in Bengal. About the same time it attacked
and decimated the central division of the army of Lord Hastings, advancing
against Gwalior. Before long it spread over the whole province of Bengal,
and eastward along the coasts of Asia as far as China and Timur in the
East Indies, crossed the great wall, and penetrated into Mongolia. In 1818
it broke out at Bombay, and during the next twelve years continued to
haunt, at intervals, the cities of Persia and Asiatic Turkey, with the
coasts of the Caspian Sea. It was not until 1829 that it reached the
Russian province of Orenburg, by way of the river Volga, visiting St.
Petersburg and Archangel in June, 1830. Thence it travelled slowly but
steadily westward through Northern Europe, as well as southward into the
valleys of the Danube and its tributaries, until it made its appearance at
Berlin and Hamburg in the summer of 1831. Long before this, and while the
reform crisis was in its acutest stage, the probability of its advent was
fully realised in England, and orders in council were issued in June,
1831, placing in quarantine all ships coming from the Baltic.
Notwithstanding the outcry against meddling with trade, men of war were
appointed to enforce these orders, and when the news came that Marshal
Diebitsch had died of the disease in Poland, the alarm increased and all
regulations against plague were made applicable to cholera. Whether or not
these precautions were ineffective, it swooped upon Sunderland on October
26, and prevailed there for two months, though its true character was very
unwillingly recognised.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

<p>The conflict between the newly created board of health and the merchants
importing goods caused the government no little perplexity. The protests
of the latter were strengthened by the somewhat remarkable fact that, once
established at Sunderland, the cholera seemed to be arrested in its course
and for a while spread no further. There seemed to be some ground for the
belief that it was partly due to extreme overcrowding and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span> neglect of all
sanitary rules in that town, but this belief was soon dissipated by its
appearance at Newcastle and progress over the north-eastern counties even
during the winter months. Seven cases of it occurred on the banks of the
Thames just below London early in February, 1832, and though its virulence
in England was alleged to be less than on the continent, further
experience hardly justified that opinion. The appalling violence of its
first onslaught on some vulnerable districts may be illustrated by the
example of Manchester, where a whole family just arrived from an infected
locality was swept away within twenty-four hours. The government did its
duty by disseminating instructions for its prevention and treatment among
the local authorities, but the prejudices of the lower orders were against
all interference for their benefit, and scenes of brutality were sometimes
enacted such as may still be witnessed in oriental cities scourged by the
plague. After a temporary decline, the visitation recurred in all its
severity, and in July the deaths of a few persons in the highest circles
occasioned a panic in the west end of London. Still the declared number of
deaths in the metropolitan area was only 5,275, showing a far lower rate
of mortality in London than in Paris at the same time, and much lower than
in London itself during the epidemic of 1849, when statistics were more
trustworthy. None of the cholera epidemics, however, approached in
deadliness the plagues of 1625 and 1665. In the latter year the number of
deaths in London from plague alone represented about one-fifth of the
entire resident population&mdash;a proportion equivalent to a mortality of
above 200,000 in the London of 1831-32. This comparative immunity was
partly due to improved sanitation, the vigorous development of which may
be said to date from the first visitation of cholera.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_241" id="TOPIC_241"></a>The census taken in 1831 revealed an increase of population, which, though
not equal to that of the preceding decade, indicated a most satisfactory
growth of wealth and employment. It was found that Great Britain contained
about 16,500,000 inhabitants, but of these, as might be expected, a
smaller percentage was employed in agriculture and a larger percentage in
manufacturing industry than in 1821. It has been calculated that since the
end of the great war the accumulation of capital had been twice as rapid
as the multiplication of the people, but, in spite of this, pauperism, as
measured by poor law expendi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>ture, had increased almost continuously since
1823, and emigration received a startling impulse in 1831-32. Rick burning
and frame breaking were the joint result of childish ignorance, miserable
wages, mistaken taxes on the staple of food, and poor laws administered as
if for the very purpose of encouraging improvidence and vice. All these
causes were capable of being removed or mitigated by legislation, for even
the rate of wages was kept down by the ruinous system of out-door relief.
But it was only a few thoughtful persons who then appreciated either the
extent or the real sources of the mischief, and the disputes which soon
arose about the proper remedies to be applied have been handed on to a
later age.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_242" id="TOPIC_242"></a>Next to parliamentary reform the state of Ireland was by far the most
important subject which engaged the attention of the legislature in
1831-32. The population had increased from 6,801,827 in 1821 to 7,767,401
in 1831, and the increase, unlike that in England, had been almost
exclusively in the agricultural districts. While the political motive for
multiplying small freeholds had ceased, the motives for multiplying small
tenancies were as strong as ever, and were felt by landlords no less than
by cottiers. This class, often inhabiting huts like those of savage tribes
and living in a squalor hardly to be seen elsewhere in western Europe,
chiefly depended for their subsistence on potatoes&mdash;the most uncertain and
the least nutritious of the crops used for human food. Many hundred
thousands of them had no employment in their own country and no means of
livelihood except the produce of the scanty patches around their own turf
cabins. Tens of thousands flocked to England annually seeking harvest
work, and a small number emigrated to Canada or the United States, the
passage money for an emigrant being then almost prohibitive. Those who
could not pay rent were liable to eviction, and eviction was a more cruel
fate then than now, since there was no poor law in Ireland. Fever was rife
in their miserable abodes, following in the steps of hunger, and for
relief of any kind they could rely only on the mercy of their landlords or
the charity of their neighbours. <a name="TOPIC_243" id="TOPIC_243"></a>Under such conditions of life crime and
disaffection could not but flourish, and the Irish peasant could hardly be
blamed if he listened eagerly to the counsels of O'Connell. For him
catholic emancipation had no meaning except so far as it gave him a hope
that parliament,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span> swayed by the great Irish demagogue, would abolish
tithes, if not rent, and find some means of making Irishmen happy in their
own country.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>ANGLESEY LORD LIEUTENANT OF IRELAND.</i></div>

<p>Had O'Connell been a true patriot, or even an honest politician, he would
have devoted his vast powers and influence to practical schemes for the
good of Ireland, and specially to a solution of the agrarian question.
Unhappily, smarting under a not unfounded sense of injustice, when he was
disabled from taking his seat for Clare, he threw his whole energy into a
new campaign for the repeal of the union, which occupied the rest of his
life. So far from acknowledging any gratitude to the whigs, through whose
support emancipation had been carried, he exhausted all the resources of
his scurrilous rhetoric upon them, lavishing the epithets "base, brutal,
and bloody," with something like Homeric iteration. In December, 1830,
Anglesey had returned to succeed the Duke of Northumberland, and Stanley
occupied the post of chief secretary, in place of Hardinge. The ministers
were privately advised to buy O'Connell at any price, and it was intimated
that he would not object to become a law officer of the crown, or at least
would not refuse a judicial appointment. It may well be doubted whether
the offer of such a bargain to such a man could have been justified by
success; it is more than probable that it would have failed, and it is
quite certain that failure would have brought infinite discredit upon the
government. At all events the attempt was not made, and other catholic
aspirants to legal promotion were passed over with less excuse.</p>

<p>Lord Anglesey proved a resolute viceroy, and proclaimed the various
associations, meetings, and processions organised by O'Connell, with
little regard for his own popularity. O'Connell's policy, carried out with
the cunning of a skilful lawyer, was to obey the law in the letter, but to
break it almost defiantly in the spirit. At last, however, he went a step
too far by advising the people who had come for a prohibited meeting to
reassemble and hold it elsewhere. He was arrested on January 18, 1831, and
pleaded "Not guilty," but on February 17, when his trial came on, he
allowed judgment to go by default against him on those counts of the
indictment which charged him with a statutable offence, provided that
other counts, which charged him with a conspiracy at common law, should be
withdrawn. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span> attorney-general assented, and the case was adjourned
until the first day in Easter term. Before that day arrived, however, the
reform bill had been introduced, and O'Connell had made a powerful speech
in support of it. In the desperate struggle which ensued, the ministers
shrunk from estranging so formidable an ally, a further adjournment of the
case was allowed, a sudden dissolution of parliament took place, the act
under which O'Connell was to be sentenced expired with the parliament, and
no further action was taken.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>"TITHE-WAR" IN IRELAND.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_244" id="TOPIC_244"></a>During the year 1831, the agitation for repeal which O'Connell had set on
foot, as soon as the emancipation act had been passed, was for a while
thrust into the shade by the fiercer agitation against tithes. This
agitation was connected, in theory, with the demand for the abolition or
reduction of the Irish Church establishment, but was, in fact, entirely
independent of that or any other constitutional movement. It may seem
inexplicable to political students of a later age that Irish questions of
secondary importance, and eminently capable of equitable treatment, should
have convulsed the whole island and disturbed the whole course of imperial
politics, during the reign of William IV. The rebellion against tithes or
"tithe-war," as it was called, had not the semblance of justification in
law or reason. Every tenant who took part in it had inherited or acquired
his farm, subject to payment of tithes, and might have been charged a
higher rent if he could have obtained it tithe-free. The tithe was the
property of the parson as much as the land was the property of the
landlord, and the wilful refusal of it was from a legal point of view
sheer robbery. On the other hand, the mode of collection was extremely
vexatious, perhaps involving the seizure of a pig, a bag of meal, or a
sack of potatoes; and a starving cottier, paying fees to his own priest,
was easily persuaded by demagogues that it was an arbitrary tribute
extorted by clerical tyrants of an alien faith.</p>

<p>Thus it came to pass that the history of the Irish "tithe-war" exhibits
the Irish peasantry in their very worst moods, and it is stained with
atrocities never surpassed in later records of Irish agrarian conspiracy.
It is among the strange and sad anomalies of national character that a
people so kindly in their domestic relations, so little prone to ordinary
crime, and so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span> amenable to better influences, should have shown, in all
ages, down to the very latest, a capacity for dastardly inhumanity, under
vindictive and gregarious impulses, only to be matched by Spanish and
Italian brigands among the races of modern Europe. Yet so it is, and no
"coercion" (so-called) ultimately enforced by legal authority was
comparable in severity with the coercion which bloodthirsty miscreants
ruthlessly applied to honest and peaceable neighbours, only guilty of
paying their lawful debts. It is not too much to say that anarchy
prevailed over a great part of Ireland, especially of Leinster, during the
years 1831 and 1832. The collection of tithes became almost impossible.
The tithe-proctors were tortured or murdered; the few willing tithe-payers
were cruelly maltreated or intimidated; the police, unless mustered in
large bodies, were held at bay; cattle were driven, or, if seized and
offered for sale, could find no purchasers; and the protestant clergy, who
had acted on the whole with great forbearance, were reduced to extremities
of privations. Five of the police were shot dead on one occasion; on
another, twelve who were escorting a tithe-proctor were massacred in cold
blood. A large number of rioters were killed in encounters with the
police, which sometimes assumed the form of pitched battles and closely
resembled civil war. Special commissions were sent down into certain
districts, and a few executions took place, but in most cases Irish juries
proved as regardless of their oaths as they ever have on trials of
prisoners for popular crimes. O'Connell, and even Sheil, tacitly
countenanced these lawless proceedings, and openly palliated them in the
house of commons.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_245" id="TOPIC_245"></a>The whig government, engaged in a life-and-death contest with the English
borough-mongers, hesitated to crush the Irish insurgents by military
force, or to initiate a sweeping reform of the Irish Church. Early in
1832, however, committees of both houses reported in favour of giving the
clergy temporary relief out of public funds, and of ultimately commuting
tithes into a charge upon the land. A preliminary bill for the former
purpose was promptly carried by Stanley, and made the government
responsible for recovering the arrears. The committee, pursuing their
inquiries, produced fuller reports, and again recommended a complete
extinction of tithes in Ireland. But the method proposed and embodied in
three bills introduced by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span> Stanley in the same year, was too complicated
to serve as a permanent settlement, and was denounced as illusory by the
Irish members. The first bill was, in fact, a compulsory extension of acts
already passed in 1822 and 1823, the former of which had permitted the
tithe-owner to lease the tithe to the landlord, while the latter permitted
the tithe-owner and tithe-payers of each parish to arrange a composition.
Unfortunately, the act of 1823 had provided that the payment in
commutation of tithe should be distributed over grass-lands hitherto
tithe-free in Ireland as well as over land hitherto liable to tithe. The
act was in consequence unpopular with a section of farmers, while at the
same time the bishops resented the commutation, as likely to diminish the
value of beneficies. But in spite of this opposition the act of 1823 had
been widely adopted. Stanley's bill to render such commutations compulsory
passed, but his other two bills, providing a new ecclesiastical machinery
for buying up tithes, were abandoned at the end of the session. Of course
the substitution of the government for the clergyman as creditor in
respect of arrears had no soothing effect on the debtors. The reign of
terror continued unabated, and O'Connell contented himself with pointing
out that without repeal there could be no peace in Ireland. We may so far
anticipate the legislation of 1833 as to notice the inevitable failure of
the experiment which converted the government into a tithe-proctor. It was
then replaced by a new plan, under which the government abandoned all
processes under the existing law, advanced &pound;1,000,000 to clear off all
arrears of tithe, and sought reimbursement by a land tax payable for a
period of five years.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>EDUCATION IN IRELAND.</i></div>

<p>It reflects credit on the unreformed house of commons that in its very
last session, harassed by the irreconcilable attitude of the catholic
population in Ireland, it should have found time and patience not only for
the pressing question of Irish tithes, but for the consideration of a
resolution introductory to an Irish poor law, of a bill (which became law)
for checking the abuses of Irish party processions, and of a grant for a
board to superintend the mixed education of Irish catholic and protestant
children. The discussion of Sadler's motion in favour of an Irish poor law
was somewhat academic, and produced a division among the Irish members,
O'Connell, with gross inconsistency, declaring himself vehemently opposed
to any such measure.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span> The ministers professed sympathy with its principle,
but would not pledge themselves to deal immediately with so difficult and
complicated a subject, perhaps foreseeing the necessity of radical change
in the English poor law system. The processions bill was vigorously
resisted on behalf of the Orangemen, as specially aimed at their annual
demonstrations on July 12, but it was so manifestly wise to remove every
wanton aggravation of party spirit in Ireland, that it was passed just
before the prorogation.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_246" id="TOPIC_246"></a>The experiment of mixed education in Ireland had already been made with
partial success, first by individuals, and afterwards by an association
known as the Kildare Place Society. On the appointment of Dr. Whately to
the archbishopric of Dublin, it received a fresh impulse, and Stanley, as
chief secretary, definitely adopted the principle, recommended by two
commissions and two committees, of "a combined moral and literary and
separate religious instruction". A board of national education was
established in Dublin, composed of eminent Roman catholics as well as
protestants, to superintend all state-aided schools in which selections
from the Bible, approved by the board, were to be read on two days in the
week. Though provision was made for unrestricted biblical teaching, out of
school hours, on the other four days, protestant bigotry was roused
against the very idea of compromise. A shrewd observer remarked, "While
the whole system is crumbling to dust under their feet, while the Church
is prostrate, property of all kind threatened, and robbery, murder,
starvation, and agitation rioting over the land, these wise legislators
are debating whether the brats at school shall read the whole Bible or
only parts of it".<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> The opponents of the national board failed to
defeat the scheme in parliament, and it was justly mentioned with
satisfaction by the king in his prorogation speech of August 16. But its
benefits, though lasting, were seriously curtailed by sectarian jealousy.
Most of the protestant clergy frowned upon the national schools, as the
Roman catholic priesthood had frowned upon the schools of the Kildare
Place Society, and a noble opportunity of mitigating religious strife in
Ireland was to a great extent wasted. Thus ended the eventful session of
1832.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV"></a>CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<h3>FRUITS OF THE REFORM.</h3>


<p><a name="TOPIC_247" id="TOPIC_247"></a>It was assumed in 1832, and has been held ever since, that a
redistribution act must be speedily followed by a dissolution, so as to
give the new constituencies the power of returning new members.
Accordingly, parliament, having been prorogued until October 16, was
further prorogued until December 3, and then finally dissolved. The
general election which followed, though awaited with much anxiety, was
orderly on the whole, and produced less change than had been expected in
the <i>personnel</i> of the house of commons. The counties, for the most part,
elected men from the landed aristocracy, the great towns elected men of
recognised distinction, and few political leaders were excluded, though
Croker abjured political life and refused to solicit a seat in the
reformed house of commons. The good sense of the country asserted itself;
while Cobbett was returned for Oldham, "Orator" Hunt was defeated at
Preston, and no general preference was shown for violent demagogues by the
more democratic boroughs. The age of members in the new house was higher,
on the average, than in the old; its social character was somewhat lower,
and the high authority of William Ewart Gladstone, who now entered
parliament for the first time, may be quoted for the opinion that it was
inferior, in the main, as a deliberative assembly. But it was certainly
superior as a representative assembly, it contained more capable men of
business, and its legislative productions, as we shall hereafter see,
claim the gratitude of posterity. A certain want of modesty in the new
class of members was observed by hostile critics, and was to be expected
in men who had won their seats by popular oratory and not through
patronage. The house of commons had already ceased to be "the best club in
London," and later re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>forms have still further weakened its title to be so
regarded, but they have also shown the wonderful power of assimilation
inherent in the atmosphere of the house itself, and the spirit of
freemasonry which springs up among those who enter it by very different
avenues.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE FIRST REFORMED PARLIAMENT.</i></div>

<p>The change wrought by the reform act in the strength and distribution of
parties was immediate and conspicuous. The ancient division of whigs and
tories, which had become well-nigh obsolete in the reign of George IV.,
had been revived by the great struggle of 1831-32. It was now superseded
to a great extent by the combination of the radicals with O'Connell's
followers into an independent section, and by the growth of a party under
Peel, distinct from the inveterate tories and known by the name of
"conservative," which first came into use in 1831.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> The preponderance
of liberalism, in its moderate and extreme forms, was overwhelming. It was
roughly computed that nearly half the house were ministerialists and about
190 members radicals, Irish repealers, or free lances, while only 150 were
classed as "conservatives," apparently including tories.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> In such
circumstances the attitude to be adopted by Peel was of the highest
constitutional importance. It is some proof of the respect for
statesmanship instinctively felt by the new house of commons that Peel, as
inexorable an opponent of reform as Canning himself, should at once have
assumed a foremost position and soon obtained an ascendency in an assembly
so largely composed of his opponents.</p>

<p>But Peel himself was no longer a mere party leader. Unlike Wellington and
Eldon, he saw the necessity of accepting loyally the accomplished fact and
shaping his future course in accordance with the nation's will. He,
therefore, took an early opportunity of declaring that he regarded the
reform act as irrevocable, and that he was prepared to participate in the
dispassionate amendment of any institution that really needed it. In a
private letter to Goulburn he stated that, in his judgment, "the best
position the government could assume would be that of moderation between
opposite extremes of ultra-toryism and radicalism," intimating further
that "we should appear to the greatest advantage in defending the
government" against their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span> own extreme left wing.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> In this policy he
persevered; his influence did much to quell the confusion and disorder of
the first debate, and his followers swelled the government majorities in
several of the early divisions. When he came to review the first session
of the reformed parliament he remarked in a private letter that what had
been foreseen took place, that "the popular assembly exercised tacitly
supreme power," and, without abolishing the crown or the house of lords,
overawed the convictions of both.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>IRISH COERCION BILL.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_248" id="TOPIC_248"></a>The passion for reform, far from spending itself in remodelling the house
of commons, filled the statute-book with monuments of remedial
legislation. No session was more fruitful in legislative activity than
that of 1833. But the way of legislation was at first blocked against all
projects of improvement by the urgent necessity of passing an Irish
coercion bill. This had been indicated in the king's speech, and on
February 15, 1833 Grey introduced the strongest measure of repression ever
devised for curbing anarchy in Ireland. It combined, as he explained, the
provisions of "the proclamation act, the insurrection act, the partial
application of martial law, and the partial suspension of the <i>habeas
corpus</i> act". But the barbarities and terrorism which it was designed to
put down were beyond precedent and almost beyond belief. The attempt to
collect the arrears of tithe, even with the aid of military force, had
usually failed, and less than an eighth of the sum due was actually
levied. The organised defiance of law was not, however, confined to
refusal of tithes; it embraced the refusal of rent and extended over the
whole field of agrarian relations. The Whiteboys of the eighteenth century
reappeared as "Whitefeet," and other secret associations, under grotesque
names, enforced their decrees by wholesale murder, burglary, arson, savage
assaults, destruction of property, and mutilation of cattle. In two
counties, Kilkenny and Queen's County, nearly a hundred murders or
attempted murders were reported within twelve months, and the murderous
intimidation of witnesses and jurors secured impunity to perpetrators of
crimes. No civilised government could have tolerated an orgy of
lawlessness on so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span> vast a scale, and nothing but the exigencies of the
reform bill can excuse Grey and his colleagues for not having grappled
with it earlier. Nor does it appear that any remedy less stern would have
been effectual. Where unarmed citizens have not the courage either to
protect themselves or to aid the constabulary employed for their
protection, soldiers, accustomed to face death and inflict it upon others
under lawful command, must be called in to maintain order. Where civil
tribunals have become a mockery, summary justice must be dealt out by
military tribunals. Force may be no remedy for grievances, but it is the
one sovereign remedy for organised crime, and this was soon to be proved
in Ireland.</p>

<p>The viceroy, Anglesey, true to his liberal instincts, would have postponed
coercion to measures of relief, such as a settlement of the church
question. Stanley, on the other hand, insisted on the prompt introduction
of a stringent peace preservation bill, and his energetic will prevailed.
The bill contained provisions enabling the lord-lieutenant to suppress any
meeting, establishing a curfew law in disturbed districts, and placing
offenders in such districts under the jurisdiction of courts martial with
legal assessors. It passed the house of lords with little discussion on
the 22nd, and was laid before the house of commons a few days later by
Althorp, who had already brought in an Irish Church temporalities bill.
The debate on the address had already given warning of the reception which
the Irish members would accord to any coercion bill, and of their
malignant hostility to Stanley. Efforts were made to delay its
introduction, and full advantage was taken of Althorp's statement that one
special commission had been completely successful. His opening speech,
tame and inconclusive, discouraged his own followers. The fate of the bill
appeared doubtful, but Stanley, who had twice staked the existence of the
ministry on its adoption, reversed the whole tendency of the debate by a
speech of marvellous force and brilliancy, which Russell afterwards
described as "one of the greatest triumphs ever won in a popular assembly
by the powers of oratory".<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> It was in this speech that he proved
himself at least a match for O'Connell, whom he scathed with fierce
indignation as having lately called the house<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span> of commons a body of
scoundrels. It cost many nights of debate to carry the bill, with slight
amendments, but Stanley's appeal had a lasting effect, and it became law
in April, to the great benefit of Ireland.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>IRISH CHURCH TEMPORALITIES BILL.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_249" id="TOPIC_249"></a>Meanwhile, the Irish Church temporalities bill was pressed forward as a
counterpoise to coercion. It imposed a graduated tax upon all episcopal,
capitular, and clerical incomes above &pound;200 a year, and placed the
proceeds, estimated at &pound;60,000 or &pound;70,000 a year, in the hands of
commissioners, to be expended in the repairs of churches, the erection of
glebe-houses, and other parochial charges. In this way Irish ratepayers
might be relieved of the obnoxious "vestry cess," a species of Church
rate, at the expense of the clergy. A further saving of &pound;60,000 a year or
upwards was to be effected by a reduction of the Irish episcopate, aided
by a new and less wasteful method of leasing Church lands attached to
episcopal sees. Two out of four Irish archbishoprics and eight out of
eighteen bishoprics were doomed to extinction, as vacancies should occur.
Dioceses and benefices were to be freely consolidated, clerical sinecures
were to cease, and the more scandalous abuses of the Irish Church were to
be redressed.</p>

<p>As a scheme for ecclesiastical rearrangement within the Church itself, the
bill was sound and liberal, but it was utterly futile to imagine that it
would be welcomed, except as a mere instalment of conciliation, by Roman
catholics who looked upon the protestant Church itself as a standing
national grievance. The only boon secured to them was exemption from their
share of vestry cess, for, though Althorp intimated that the ultimate
surplus to be realised by the union of sees and livings would be at the
disposal of parliament, they well knew how many influences would operate
to prevent its reaching them. Not even O'Connell, still less the ministry,
ventured to propose "concurrent endowment" as it was afterwards called,
and the very idea of diverting revenues from the protestant establishment
to Roman catholic uses was disclaimed with horror. More than a century
earlier, a partition of these revenues between the great protestant
communions had been seriously entertained, and Pitt had notoriously
contemplated a provision for the Roman catholic priests out of state
funds. But no such demand was now made, and the one feature of the bill
which commanded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span> the vigorous support of O'Connell and his adherents was
the 147th section, or "appropriation clause," which enabled parliament to
apply the expected surplus of some &pound;60,000 in income, or some &pound;3,000,000
in capital, to whatever purposes, secular or otherwise, it might think fit
to approve. The far-reaching importance of this principle was fully
understood on both sides. To radicals and Roman catholics it was the sole
virtue of the bill; to friends of the Irish Church and tories it was a
blot to be erased at any cost.</p>

<p>The progress of the measure was not rapid. Its nature had been explained
by Althorp on February 12, but it was not in print on March 11 when,
notwithstanding the reasonable protest of Peel, he induced the house to
fix the second reading for the 14th. It was then found that, owing to its
form, it must be preceded by resolutions, in order to satisfy the rules of
the house. These resolutions, containing the essence of the bill, were
proposed on April 1, but were not adopted without a long debate, and the
debate on the second reading did not begin until May 6. It ended in a
majority of 317 to 78 for the government, chiefly due to a moderate speech
from Sir Robert Peel, who, however, denounced the policy of
"appropriation". The discussion in committee was far more vehement, and
radicals like Hume did not shrink from avowing their desire to pull down
the Irish establishment, root and branch. The attack on the conservative
side was mainly concentrated on the appropriation clause. In vain was it
argued that a great part of the expected surplus was not Church property,
inasmuch as it would result from improvements in the system of episcopal
leases to be carried out by the agency of the state. Every one saw that,
however disguised, and whether legitimate or not, appropriation of the
surplus for secular purposes would be an act of confiscation, and must
needs be interpreted as a precedent.</p>

<p>The cabinet itself was divided on the subject, and despaired of saving the
bill in the house of lords, without sacrificing the disputed clause. On
June 21, therefore, Stanley announced in the house of commons that the
appropriation clause would be withdrawn, and that any profits arising out
of financial reforms within the Church would be allowed to fall into the
hands of the ecclesiastical commissioners. The fury of O'Connell was
unbounded, and not so devoid of excuse as many of his passionate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
outbreaks. He treated the Church bill as the stipulated price to be paid
for the coercion bill, and the appropriation clause as the only part of
it, except relief from vestry cess, which could possess the smallest value
for Irish Roman catholics. There was no valid answer to his argument,
except that another collision with the house of lords must be avoided at
any tolerable cost, for, as Russell bluntly said, "the country could not
stand a revolution once a year". Thus lightened, and slightly modified in
the interest of Irish incumbents, the bill passed through committee and
was read a third time by very large majorities, the minority being mainly
composed of its old radical partisans. Peel's letters show how anxious he
was to "make the reform bill work," by protecting the government against
this extreme faction,<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> and the parliamentary reports show how much he
did to frustrate the attempt to intimidate the lords by a resolution of
the commons.</p>

<p>The debate in the upper house lasted three nights in July, but is almost
devoid of permanent interest. The appropriation question being dropped,
there was little to discuss except the historical origin of Irish
dioceses, the precedents for their consolidation, and the economical
details of the scheme for equalising, in some degree, the incomes of Irish
clergymen. Two or three peers, headed by the Duke of Cumberland, took
their stand once more on the coronation oath, and Bishop Phillpotts of
Exeter availed himself of this objection in one of the most powerful
speeches delivered against the bill. On the other hand, Bishop Blomfield
of London, and the Duke of Wellington, now acting in concert with Peel,
gave it a grudging support, as the less of two evils. After passing the
second reading by a majority of 157 to 98, it was subjected to minute
criticism in committee, and one amendment was carried against the
government, but Grey wisely declined to relinquish it except on some vital
issue. The majority on the third reading was 135 to 81, and on August 2
the commons agreed to the lords' amendments, O'Connell remarking that,
after all, the peers had not made the bill much worse than they found it.
More than a generation was to elapse before this "act to alter and amend
the laws relating to the temporalities of the Church in Ireland"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span> was
completed by an act severing that Church from the state. But the ulterior
aims of those who first challenged the sanctity of Church endowments were
not concealed, and the more than Erastian tendency of the liberal movement
was henceforth clearly perceived by high Churchmen. We know, on the
authority of Dr. Newman, that he and his early associates regarded the
Anglican revival of which they were the pioneers as essentially a reaction
against liberalism, and liberalism as the most formidable enemy of
sacerdotal power.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>STANLEY COLONIAL SECRETARY.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_250" id="TOPIC_250"></a>Long before the Irish church bill had passed the house of commons Stanley
exchanged the chief secretaryship of Ireland for the higher office of
colonial secretary, to which he was gazetted on March 28. His
uncompromising advocacy of the coercion bill, and his known hostility to
direct spoliation of the Church, alike provoked the hatred of Irish Roman
catholics, and Brougham had already advised his retirement from Ireland.
His promotion was facilitated by the resignation of Durham, nominally on
grounds of health, but also because he was in constant antagonism to his
own father-in-law, Grey, and his moderate colleagues in the cabinet. He
received an earldom, and was succeeded as lord privy seal by Goderich, who
became Earl of Ripon. This opened the colonial office to Stanley, who
instantly found himself face to face with a question almost as intractable
as the pacification of Ireland. Sir John Hobhouse became chief secretary
for Ireland, but without a seat in the cabinet. He resigned in May, and
was succeeded by Edward John Littleton, who was married to a natural
daughter of the Marquis Wellesley.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_251" id="TOPIC_251"></a>Among the statutes passed in 1833, there are several, besides those
relating to Ireland, of sufficient importance to confer distinction upon
any parliamentary session. One of these is entitled "an act for the better
administration of justice in His Majesty's privy council"; a second, "an
act for the abolition of slavery throughout the British colonies, for
promoting the industry of the manumitted slaves, and for compensating the
persons hitherto entitled to the services of such slaves"; a third, "an
act for the abolition of fines and recoveries, and for the substitution of
more simple methods of assurance"; a fourth, "an act to regulate the trade
to China and India"; a fifth, "an act for giving to the corporation of the
governor and company<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span> of the Bank of England certain privileges, for a
limited period, under certain conditions"; a sixth, "an act to regulate
the labour of children and young persons in the mills and factories of the
United Kingdom". Not one of these salutary measures was forced upon the
legislature by popular clamour, every one of them represents a sincere
zeal for what has been ridiculed as "world-bettering," and the parliament
that passed them must have been thoroughly imbued with the spirit of
reform.</p>

<p>Foremost of these measures, as a monument of philanthropic legislation,
will ever stand the act for the abolition of colonial slavery. No class in
the country was concerned in its promotion; the powerful interests of the
planters were arrayed against it; and humanity, operating through public
opinion, was the only motive which could induce a government to espouse
the anti-slavery cause. Stanley had not occupied his new office many weeks
when on May 14 it became his lot to explain the ministerial scheme in the
house of commons. Its essence consisted in the immediate extinction of
absolute property in slaves, but with somewhat complicated provisions for
an intermediate state of apprenticeship, to last twelve years. During this
period negroes were to be maintained by their former masters, under an
obligation to serve without wages for three-fourths of their working
hours, and were to earn wages during the remaining fourth. All children
under six years of age were to become free at once, and all born after the
passing of the act were to be free at birth. The proprietors were to
receive compensation by way of loan, to the extent of &pound;15,000,000, and
additional grants were promised for the institution of a stipendiary
magistracy and a system of education.</p>

<p>Several resolutions embodying the scheme were carried, with little
opposition, though some abolitionists, headed by Mr. Fowell Buxton, a
wealthy brewer and eminent philanthropist, who sat for Weymouth, took
strong exception to compulsory apprenticeship, as perpetuating the
principle of slavery, however mitigated by the recognition of personal
liberty and the suppression of corporal punishment. It was found
expedient, however, in deference to a very strong remonstrance from West
Indian proprietors, to convert the proposed loan of &pound;15,000,000 into an
absolute payment of &pound;20,000,000, and this noble donation, for conscience'
sake, was actually ratified by parliament and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span> country. The bill
founded on the resolutions met with no serious opposition, but an
amendment by Buxton for adopting free labour at once was lost by so narrow
a majority that Stanley consented to reduce the period of apprenticeship
to an average of six years. In this instance the lords followed the
guidance of the commons, and a measure of almost quixotic liberalism was
endorsed by them without hesitation. It must be confessed that experience
has not verified the confident prediction that free labour would prove
more profitable than slave labour, but Great Britain has never repented of
the abolition act, and its example was followed, thirty years later, by
the United States.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>FACTORY ACTS.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_252" id="TOPIC_252"></a>The first of the general factory acts was marked by the same philanthropic
character, but here the manufacturing capitalists, introduced by the
reform act, were induced by self-interest to oppose it. Ever since the
beginning of the century the sufferings and degradation of children in
factories had occasionally engaged the attention of parliament, but the
full enormity of the factory system was known to few except those who
profited by it. It seems incredible, but it was shown afterwards by
irresistible evidence, that children of seven years old and upwards were
often compelled to work twelve or fourteen hours a day, with two short
intervals for meals, in a most unwholesome atmosphere, exposed not only to
ill-treatment but to every form of moral corruption. A very partial remedy
was applied by a law passed in 1802 which restricted the hours of labour
to twelve for mills in which apprentices were employed. The same limit of
hours was extended to cotton mills generally in 1816, and, but for the
resistance of the house of lords, it would have been reduced to ten, as a
select committee had recommended on the initiative of the first Sir Robert
Peel. A few years later the question was revived by Sir John Hobhouse, but
left unsettled. In 1831 Sadler introduced a ten hours bill for children,
and obtained a select committee, before which disclosures were made well
calculated to shock the country. At the general election of 1832, Sadler
was defeated by Macaulay for the new borough of Leeds, but his mantle fell
on Lord Ashley, afterwards Earl of Shaftesbury, one of the noblest
philanthropists of modern times.</p>

<p>Early in the session of 1833 Ashley introduced a ten hours bill,
applicable, like that of Sadler, to all young persons under<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span> eighteen
years of age working in factories. It also prohibited the employment of
children under nine, and provided for the appointment of inspectors. It
was strongly opposed by the Lancashire members as interfering with freedom
of labour even for adults, since mills could not be kept running without
the labour of boys under eighteen. They also objected to the evidence
already reported as one-sided, and succeeded in procuring the appointment
of a royal commission. This commission prosecuted its inquiries with
unusual despatch, but its report was not in the hands of members on July
5, when the bill came on for its second reading. Though Althorp, unwilling
to offend the manufacturing interest, pleaded for deliberation and urged
that a select committee should frame the regulations to be adopted, the
majority of the house was impatient of delay, and he encountered a defeat.
The question now resolved itself into a choice between a greater or less
limitation of hours. On this question, a compromise proposed by Althorp
prevailed, and Ashley resigned the conduct of the bill into his hands. It
was further modified in committee, but ultimately became law in a form
which secured the main objects of its promoters. No child under nine years
of age could be employed at all in a factory, after two years none under
thirteen could be worked more than eight hours, and no young person under
eighteen could be required to work more than sixty-nine hours a week,
while the provisions for inspection were retained along with others which
contained the germ of education on the half-time system.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE EAST INDIA COMPANY.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_253" id="TOPIC_253"></a>The trading monopoly of the East India Company, though confined to China
by the act of 1813, had been regarded ever since with great jealousy by
the mercantile community. As the revised charter was now on the point of
expiring, it was for the government to frame terms of renewal which might
satisfy the growing demand for free trade. Their scheme, which few were
competent to criticise, met with general approval, and the only determined
opposition to it was offered in the house of lords by Ellenborough, who
lived to come into sharp collision with the court of directors as
governor-general. It was embodied in three simple resolutions, the first
of which recommended the legislature to open the China trade without
reserve, the second provided for the assumption by the crown of all the
company's assets and liabilities but with the obligation of paying the
com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>pany a fixed subsidy, while the last affirmed the expediency of
entrusting the company with the political government of India. Grant, who
moved these resolutions, as president of the board of control, had no
occasion to defend the policy of setting free the China trade which no one
disputed; but he undertook to show that it had declined in the hands of
the company, and that private competition had already crept in on a large
scale. He also dwelt on the advantage of bringing the political relations
arising out of commercial intercourse more directly under the control of
the government. His reasoning was sound, and the China trade rapidly
developed, nor could he be expected to foresee the course of events
whereby the government afterwards became embroiled with the Chinese
empire, on the importation of opium, and other economical questions. As
compensation for the loss of its exclusive privileges, the company was to
receive an annuity of &pound;630,000, charged on the territorial revenues of
India.</p>

<p>The policy of continuing the company's rule in India for twenty years
longer would have excited more earnest discussion in a session less
crowded with legislative projects. The way had been paved for the
concession of complete free trade in the eastern seas by the reports of
select committees and parliamentary debates under former governments. The
consumers of tea, numbered by millions, promised themselves a better
quality at a lower price, and a keen spirit of enterprise was kindled by
the idea of breaking into the unknown resources of China. But public
interest in the administration of India was languid. It might well have
appeared that a board sitting in Leadenhall Street was fitter to conduct
shipping and mercantile operations than to govern an imperial dependency
like British India. But the contrary alternative was almost tacitly
accepted. The directors were "to remain princes, but no longer merchant
princes," and Ellenborough complained that whereas "hitherto the court had
appeared in India as beneficent conquerors, henceforth they would be
mortgagees in possession". Perhaps the ministry shrunk from provoking the
storm of obloquy which must have resulted from placing the vast patronage
of the company in the hands of the crown. At all events, it was agreed,
with little dissent, that under the new charter the company should
nominally retain the reins of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span> power, checked, however, by Pitt's "board
of control," the president of which, in reality, shared a despotic
authority with the governor-general of Bengal, who was hereafter to be in
name what he had long been in fact, governor-general of India. The bill
strengthened his council, and enabled him to legislate for all India.</p>

<p>At the same time Europeans were permitted to settle and hold land in India
without the necessity of applying for a licence. Lastly, the principle was
laid down, pregnant with future consequences, that all persons in India,
without distinction of race or creed, should be subject to the same law
and eligible for all offices under the government. Such was the last
charter of the great company. It is interesting to observe that Grant, in
admitting that the government of India under its sway had not been prone
"to make any great or rapid strides in improvement," paid a just tribute
to its eminently pacific character. "It excited vigilance," he said,
"against any encroachment of violence or rapacity; it ensured to the
people that which they most required&mdash;repose, security, and tranquillity."
The immense annexations of territory and far-reaching reforms which have
created the British India of the twentieth century were either most
reluctantly sanctioned by the court of directors or have been carried out
since its dominion was transferred to the crown. Irrevocable as they are,
and beneficent as they may be on the whole, they have certainly imposed
difficulties of portentous magnitude upon the rulers of India, nor would
it be surprising if some native survivors of the olden days in far-off
recesses of the country should remember with sad regret the paternal,
though unprogressive, despotism of the sovereign company.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE BANK CHARTER ACT.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_254" id="TOPIC_254"></a>The bank charter act of 1833, having been superseded by that of 1844,
fills a less important place than it otherwise would in the history of
legislation on currency. The bill was founded, however, on the report of a
secret committee which embraced Peel as well as Althorp and several other
members of high financial repute or great experience in the city. Since
the subject of it was familiar to a large section of members engaged in
business, and touched the pockets of bankers all over the country, it was
discussed in the house of commons far more earnestly than the bill
renewing the charter of the East India Company. In the end two provisions
were dropped, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span> directly encouraged the increase of joint stock
banks. The rest were passed, and contained important modifications of the
banking system as it then existed. The main privileges of the Bank of
England were continued, in spite of a strong opposition and of protests
against the one-sided inquiry said to have been conducted by the secret
committee. These privileges embraced the exclusive possession of the
government balances, the monopoly of limited liability, then refused to
other banks, and the right, shared by no other joint stock bank, of
issuing its own notes. Though private London banks might have legally
exercised this power they did not actually do so, and nearly all of them
deposited their reserves with the Bank of England.</p>

<p>Another part of the scheme, which even Peel condemned, was thus briefly
stated in a preliminary resolution: "That, provided the Bank of England
continued liable, as at present, to defray in the current coin of the
realm all its existing engagements, it was expedient that its promissory
notes should be constituted a legal tender for sums of &pound;5 and upwards". In
other words, country bankers would no longer be compelled to cash their
own notes, or pay off their deposits in gold, but might use Bank of
England notes instead, above the value of &pound;5. The Bank of England,
however, and all its branches, remained liable to cash payments, as
before, so that, as Baring argued, only one intermediate stage was
interposed between the presentation of a country note and the exchange of
it for specie. Peel's objection, which did not prevail, chiefly rested on
the danger of the Bank of England closing its branches in its own
interests, in order to check the demand for cash. Though his fears were
not literally realised, experience disclosed the danger of country banks
multiplying unduly, and, by their over-issue of notes, causing a severe
drain upon the Bank of England for gold. For the present, however, the
critics of the measure were less concerned in forecasting such remote
consequences than in protesting against the charge to be made by the bank
for managing the public debt. This charge was, in fact, to be reduced by
&pound;120,000 a year, but one-fourth part of the advances made by the bank to
the public (or &pound;3,671,700) was to be paid off, and the proposed
remuneration was denounced as exorbitant. Althorp hardly denied that it
was a good bargain for the bank, though he persuaded the house of commons
to endorse the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span> arrangement, rather than incur the dislocation of national
finance and commercial business certain to ensue if the bank should
withdraw from its connexion with the government and use its vast influence
for its own interest alone.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>LEGAL REFORMS.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_255" id="TOPIC_255"></a>Two great law reforms close the series of important remedial measures
passed in the first session of the reformed parliament&mdash;a session, be it
remembered, which embraced all the furious and protracted debates on the
Irish coercion act and the Irish Church temporalities act. The first of
these was Brougham's valuable bill constituting a permanent "judicial
committee of the privy council," and transferring to it the judicial
functions theoretically belonging to "the king in council," but
practically exercised by committees selected <i>ad hoc</i> on each occasion.
Charles Greville, to whose memoirs all historians of this period are
greatly indebted, and who in 1833 was clerk of the council, was inclined
to disparage the proposed change as one of Brougham's fanciful projects,
designed to gratify his own self-importance.<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> Even Greville, however,
saw reason to modify his view, and the new court has ever since commanded
general respect, except from those high Churchmen who resented its
assumption of the appellate jurisdiction in ecclesiastical causes,
formerly vested, along with a similar jurisdiction in admiralty causes, in
the king in chancery, and exercised by a "court of delegates," usually
consisting of three common law judges and three or four civilians selected
<i>ad hoc</i>.</p>

<p>The essential defects of such a court were fully stated in the report of a
very strong commission, including six bishops, appointed in 1830. Probably
the expediency of reforming the jurisdiction of the privy council for the
purpose of hearing these ecclesiastical appeals may have suggested to
Brougham the idea of constructing a standing appellate tribunal within the
privy council, for the purpose of hearing all appeals that might come
before that body. Accordingly, after carrying a bill in 1832 whereby the
privy council, as such, took over the powers of the "court of delegates,"
he introduced the general bill whereby the judicial committee was created,
and under which it still acts. It was to consist of the lord chancellor,
with the present and past holders of certain high judicial offices, and
two privy councillors<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span> to be appointed by the sovereign; to whom prelates,
being privy councillors, were to be added for ecclesiastical appeals. The
system thus founded, and since developed, is capable of indefinite
expansion, in case still closer relations should be established between
Great Britain and the colonies.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_256" id="TOPIC_256"></a>The act for the abolition of fines and recoveries, though scarcely
intelligible except to lawyers, was a masterpiece not only of
draughtsmanship, but of honest law amendment. It swept away grotesque and
antiquated forms of conveyance, which had lost their meaning for
centuries, and which nothing but professional self-interest kept alive.
Had it been followed up by legislation in a like spirit on other
departments of law, the profits of lawyers and the needless expenses of
clients might have been reduced to an extent of which the unlearned public
has no conception. As it was, it simplified the process of selling land in
a remarkable degree, though it left untouched the complications of title
and transfer affecting real property, which no lord chancellor since
Brougham has been courageous enough to attack in earnest, and which remain
the distinctive reproach of English law. It is not without shame that we
read in the king's prorogation speech, delivered on August 29, 1833, the
assurance that he will heartily co-operate with parliament in making
justice easily accessible to all his subjects. He adds that, with this
view, a commission has been issued "for digesting into one body the
enactments of the criminal law, and for inquiring how far, and by what
means, a similar process may be extended to the other branches of
jurisprudence". Seventy years have since elapsed, yet this royal promise
of codification is not even in course of fulfilment. On the other hand,
Brougham's scheme for establishing local courts in certain parts of the
kingdom was destined to bear ample fruit in the next reign. It was
described by Eldon as "a most abominable bill," and, being generally
opposed by the law lords, was rejected by a small majority, but it was the
germ of the county courts, which have since done so much to bring justice
within the reach and the means of poor suitors.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding its legislative exploits, the whig government was
declining in popularity at the end of 1833, and was beginning to discover
how vain it is to rely on political gratitude. Other reforming governments
have since undergone the same<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span> bitter experience, the causes of which are
by no means obscure. No reform can be effected without "harassing
interests," and the sense of resentment in the sections of the community
thus harassed is far stronger and more efficacious than any appreciation
of the benefits reaped by the general public at home, or by mankind at
large. Again, the expectations excited by the agitation of such a question
as parliamentary reform are far beyond the power of any legislature to
satisfy. Grey and his colleagues were too well aware of this, and Stanley,
for one, manfully championed the government measures on their own merits,
disdaining to flatter the radicals, but his discretion was not equal to
his valour, and every debate brought into stronger relief the more
statesmanlike capacity and moderation of Peel. There was no tory reaction,
but a growing distrust of heroic remedies for national disorders, and a
growing faith in the possible development of a liberal policy in a
conservative spirit. Even the Duke of Wellington found himself restored
insensibly to popular favour, and was again received in the streets with
marks of public respect.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>ALTHORP'S THIRD BUDGET.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_257" id="TOPIC_257"></a>Of all the ministers, no one enjoyed a greater share of confidence both in
and out of parliament than Althorp. He was not a great financier, but he
was an honest and prudent chancellor of the exchequer, a free-trader by
conviction, and incapable of those artifices by which a plausible
balance-sheet may be made out at the cost of future liabilities. Yet his
budgets of 1831, 1832, and 1833 undoubtedly helped to shake the credit of
the government. The first had been far too ambitious, and became almost
futile, when the proposed tax on transfers was abandoned, and the timber
duties left undisturbed. The second was modest enough, and was saved from
damaging criticism by the absorbing interest of the reform bill.
Considerable reductions were made in the estimates, the revenue yielded
somewhat more than had been expected, and Althorp was enabled to present a
favourable account in 1833. He anticipated a surplus of about a million
and a half, out of which he was prepared to abolish certain vexatious
duties and to decrease others. But the country gentlemen, headed by
Ingilby, member for Lincolnshire, insisted on a reduction of the malt duty
by one-half, while the borough members, headed by Sir John Key, clamoured
for a repeal of the house tax and window tax. The former motion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span> was
actually carried against the government by a small majority, but its
effect was annulled, and the latter motion was defeated, by a skilful
man&oelig;uvre. This consisted in the proposal by Althorp of a
counter-resolution, declaring that, if half of the malt tax and the whole
tax on windows and houses were to be taken off, it would be necessary to
meet the deficiency by a general income tax. Such a prospect was equally
alarming to the landed interest and the householders, whose rival demands
were mutually destructive, the result being that Althorp's amendment was
carried by a large majority, and the government escaped humiliation,
though not without some loss of prestige.</p>

<p>It was perhaps to be expected that private members in the first session of
the reformed parliament should be eager to gain a hearing for their
special projects of improvement. So it was, but two only of these projects
deserved historical mention. One of these was the abortive attempt of
Attwood, the radical member for Birmingham, to reverse the policy of 1819
by inducing parliament to initiate the return to a paper currency. Cobbett
actually followed up this failure by moving for an address praying the
king to dismiss Sir Robert Peel from his councils, a motion defeated by a
majority of 295 to 4.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI"></a>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>

<h3>RELIGIOUS MOVEMENTS AND POOR LAW REFORM.</h3>


<p>The year 1833, so fruitful in legislation, may be said to have witnessed
the birth of a religious movement which has profoundly affected the
character of the national Church. The neo-catholic revival, which
afterwards took its popular name from Pusey but drew its chief inspiration
from Newman, was in a great degree the outcome of the reform act and a
reaction against the more than Erastian tendencies of the reformed
parliament. In the early part of the century, as we have seen, personal
and practical religion was mainly represented by the evangelical or low
Church party, which did admirable service in the cause of philanthropy, as
well as in reclaiming the masses from heathenism. The high Church party
was comparatively inactive, but co-operated with its rival in opposition
to catholic emancipation. The clergy, as a body, were hostile to reform,
and the bishops incurred the fiercest obloquy by voting against the first
reform bill, which had unfortunately been rejected by a majority exactly
corresponding with the number of their votes.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> The democratic outcry
against the Church became louder and louder, as the evils of nepotism,
pluralism, and sinecurism were exposed to public criticism, and a growing
disposition was shown to deal with Church endowments both in England and
in Ireland, if not as the property of the state, yet as under its
paramount control.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE TRACTARIAN MOVEMENT.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_258" id="TOPIC_258"></a>The recent infusion of Irish Roman catholics into the house of commons,
following that of Scotch presbyterians a century earlier, rendered it less
and less fit, in the opinion of high Churchmen, to legislate for the
Church of England, and every concession to religious liberty shocked them
as a step towards "National<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span> Apostasy". This was, in fact, the impressive
title of a sermon preached by John Keble, in July, 1833, before the
university of Oxford. From this sermon Newman himself dated the origin of
the Oxford or "Tractarian" movement, but its inward source lay deeper.
Having lost all confidence in the state and even in the Anglican hierarchy
as a creature of the state, a section of the clergy had already been
looking about for another basis of authority, and had found it in theories
of apostolical succession and Church organisation. The university of
Oxford was a natural centre for such a reaction, and it was set on foot
with the deliberate purpose of defending the Church and the Christianity
of England against the anti-catholic aggressions of the dominant
liberalism. It was not puritanism but liberal secularism which Newman
always denounced as the arch-enemy of the catholic faith. For, as Wesley's
sympathies were originally with high Church doctrines, so Newman's
sympathies were originally with evangelical doctrines, nor were they ever
entirely stifled by his ultimate secession to the Roman Church.</p>

<p>The later development of this movement, which had its cradle in the common
room of Oriel College, belongs rather to ecclesiastical history, and to
the reign of Queen Victoria. But from the first it rallied a considerable
body of support. Many who were not influenced by the movement, shared its
earlier aspirations. Shortly after the formation of an association, under
Newman and Keble's auspices, seven or eight thousand of the clergy signed
an address to the Archbishop of Canterbury, insisting upon the necessity
of restoring Church discipline, maintaining Church principles, and
checking the progress of latitudinarianism. A large section of the laity
ranged themselves on the side of the revival, and meetings were held
throughout England. The king himself volunteered a declaration of his
strong affection for the national Church now militant, and prepared to
assert itself, not merely as a true branch of the catholic Church, but as
a co-ordinate power with the state. In the autumn of 1833, Newman and one
of his colleagues launched the first of that series of tracts from which
his followers derived the familiar name of Tractarians. From that day he
was their recognised leader, yet he claimed no allegiance and issued no
commands. He felt himself, not the creator of a new party, but a loyal son
of the old Church, at last awakened from her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span> lethargy. The spell which he
exercised over so many young minds was due to a personal influence of
which he was almost unconscious, but which spread from the pulpit of St.
Mary's Church and his college rooms at Oriel over a great part of the
university and the Church. It was broken some years later, when he gave up
the <i>via media</i> which he had so long been advocating, accepted the logical
consequences of his own teaching, and reproached others for not
discovering that Anglicanism was but a pale and deformed counterfeit of
the primitive Christianity represented, in its purity, by the Church of
Rome.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_259" id="TOPIC_259"></a>Looking back at this movement across an interval of seventy years, we may
well feel astonished that it satisfied the aspirations of inquisitive
minds in contact with the ideas of their own times. For this was the age
of Benthamism in social philosophy and "German neology" in biblical
criticism. Though national education was in its infancy, a new desire for
knowledge, and even a free-thinking spirit, was permeating the middle
classes, and had gained a hold among the more intelligent of the artisans.
The Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, established by
Brougham, circulated a mass of instructive and stimulating literature at a
cheap rate; popular magazines and cyclop&aelig;dias were multiplying yearly; and
the British Association, which held its first meeting at Oxford in 1832,
brought the results of natural science within the reach of thousands and
tens of thousands incapable of scientific research. The <i>Bridgwater
Treatises</i>, which belong to the reign of William IV., are evidence of a
widespread anxiety to reconcile the claims and conclusions of science with
those of the received theology. Thoughtful and religious laymen in the
higher ranks of society were earnestly seeking a reason for the faith that
was in them, and pondering over fundamental problems like the personality
of God, the divinity of Christ, the reality of supernatural agency, and
the awful mystery of the future life. Yet the tractarians passed lightly
over all these problems, to exercise themselves and others with
disputations on points which to most laymen of their time appeared
comparatively trivial.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE CATHOLIC APOSTOLIC CHURCH.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_260" id="TOPIC_260"></a>To them Church authority was supreme, and every catholic dogma a
self-evident truth. What engrossed their reason and consciences was the
discussion of questions affecting Church authority, for example, whether
the Anglican Church pos<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>sessed the true note of catholicity or was in a
state of schism, whether its position in Christendom was not on a par with
that of the monophysite heretics, whether its articles could be brought
into conformity with the Roman catholic doctrines expressly condemned by
them, or whether its alliance with Lutheranism in the appointment of a
bishop for Jerusalem did not amount to ecclesiastical suicide. Their
message, unlike that of the early Christian or methodist preachers, was
for the priestly order, and not for the masses of the people; their
appeals were addressed <i>ad clerum</i> not <i>ad populum</i>; still less were they
suited to influence scientific intellects. But their propaganda was
carried on by men of intense earnestness and holy lives, few in number but
strong in well-organised combination, and they carried with them for a
time many to whom any "movement" seemed better than lifeless "high and
dry" conformity. Herein consisted the secret of their early success. Their
subsequent failure was inevitable when they were fairly confronted with
protestant sentiment and with the independent spirit of the age. How their
aims were taken up and partially realised in a new form by new leaders and
through new methods, is an inquiry which must be reserved for a later
chapter in the history of the English Church.</p>

<p>The strange religious movement which resulted in the foundation of the
so-called Catholic Apostolic Church was of somewhat earlier date, and its
author had already been disavowed as a minister by the presbyterian Church
before the <i>Tracts for the Times</i> began to startle the religious world.
The most brilliant part of Edward Irving's career falls within the reign
of George IV., when his chapel in London was crowded by the fashionable
world, and even attended occasionally by statesmen like Canning. According
to all contemporary testimony he was among the most remarkable of modern
preachers, and his visionary speculations in the field of biblical
prophecy failed to repel hearers attracted by his wonderful religious
enthusiasm. Compared with the adherents of the methodist or of the
neo-catholic revival, his followers were a mere handful, and his name
would scarcely merit a place in history but for the impression which he
made upon men of high ability and position. What brought him into
discredit with his own communion and with the public was his introduction
into his services of fanatics professing the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span> gift of speaking with
"unknown tongues". These extravagances led to his deposition in 1832, and
probably hastened his early death in 1834. But his creed did not die with
him, and a small body of earnest believers has carried on into the
twentieth century a definite tradition of the gospel which he taught.</p>

<p>Far deeper and more lasting in its effects was the change wrought in
current ideas by the almost unseen but steady advance of science in all
its branches. During this epoch perhaps the most formidable enemy of
orthodoxy was the rising study of geology, challenging, as it did, the
traditional theories of creation. The discoveries of astronomy&mdash;the law of
gravitation, the rotation of the earth, its place in the solar system,
and, above all, the infinite compass of the universe&mdash;were in themselves
of a nature to revolutionise theological beliefs more radically than any
conclusions respecting the antiquity of the earth. But it may be doubted
whether it was so in fact; at all events, theologians had slowly learned
to harmonise their doctrines with the conception of immeasurable space,
when they were suddenly required to admit the conception of immeasurable
time, and staggered under the blow. The pioneers of English geology were
careful to avoid shocking religious opinion, and Buckland devotes a
chapter of his famous <i>Treatise on Geology</i> to showing "the consistency of
geological discoveries with sacred history". His explanation is that an
undefined interval may have elapsed after the creation of the heaven and
the earth "in the beginning" as recorded in the first verse of Genesis;
and he rejects as opposed to geological evidence "the derivation of
existing systems of organic life, by an eternal succession, from preceding
individuals of the same species, or by gradual transmutation of one
species into another". But speculations of this order were utterly ignored
by such religious leaders as Newman and Irving, whose spiritual fervour,
however apostolical in its influence on the hearts of their disciples, was
confined within the narrowest circle of intellectual interests.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>POOR LAW.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_261" id="TOPIC_261"></a>The great event of parliamentary history in 1834, and the crowning
achievement of the first reformed parliament, was the enactment of the
"new poor law," as it was long called. No measure of modern times so well
represents the triumph of reason over prejudice; none has been so
carefully based on thorough inquiry and the deliberate acceptance of sound
prin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>ciples; none has so fully stood the conclusive test of experience. It
is not too much to say that it was essentially a product of the reform
period, and could scarcely have been carried either many years earlier or
many years later. In the dark age which followed the great war, contempt
for political economy, coupled with a weak sentiment of humanity, would
have made it impossible for a far-sighted treatment of national pauperism
and distress to obtain a fair hearing. After the introduction of household
suffrage, and the growth of socialism, any resolute attempt to diminish
the charge upon ratepayers for the immediate relief but ultimate
degradation of the struggling masses would have met with the most
desperate resistance from the new democracy. The philosophical whigs and
radicals, trained in the school of Bentham, and untainted as yet by a
false philanthropy, found themselves in possession of an opportunity which
might never have recurred. They deserved the gratitude of posterity by
using it wisely and courageously.</p>

<p>The irregular development of the poor laws, from the act of Elizabeth down
to that of 1834, belongs to economic rather than to general history. It is
enough to say here that in later years, and especially since the system of
allowances adopted by the Berkshire magistrates at Speenhamland in 1795
had become general, the original policy of relieving only the destitute
and helpless, and compelling able-bodied men to earn their own living, had
been entirely obscured by the intrusion of other ideas. The result was
admirably described in the report of a commission, appointed in 1832, with
the most comprehensive powers of investigation and recommendation. The
commissioners were the Bishops of London (Blomfield) and Chester (Sumner),
Sturges Bourne, Edwin Chadwick, and four others less known, but well
versed in the questions to be considered. A summary of the information
collected by them, ranging over the whole field of poor-law management,
was published in February, 1834. It astounded the benighted public of that
day, and it still remains on record as a wonderful revelation of ruinous
official infatuation on the largest possible scale. The evil system was
found to be almost universal, but the worst examples of it were furnished
by the southern counties of England. There, an actual premium was set upon
improvidence, if not on vice, by the wholesale practice of giving out-door
relief in aid of wages,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span> and in proportion to the number of children in
the family, legitimate or illegitimate. The excuse was that it was better
to eke out scanty earnings by doles than to break up households, and bring
all their inmates into the workhouse. The inevitable effect of such action
was that wages fell as doles increased, that paupers so pensioned were
preferred by the farmers to independent labourers because their labour was
cheaper, and that independent labourers, failing to get work except at
wages forced down to a minimum, were constantly falling into the ranks of
pauperism.</p>

<p>Had some theorists of a later generation witnessed the social order then
prevailing in country districts, they would have found several of their
favourite objects practically attained. There was no competition between
the working people; old and young, skilled and unskilled hands, the
industrious and the idle, were held worthy of equal reward, the actual
allowance to each being measured by his need and not by the value of his
work; while the parochial authorities, figuring as an earthly providence,
exercised a benevolent superintendence over the welfare and liberty of
every day-labourer in the village community. The fruits of that
superintendence were the decline of a race of freemen into a race of
slaves, unconscious of their slavery, and the gradual ruin of the
landlords and farmers upon whom the maintenance of these slaves
depended.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>NEW POOR LAW.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_262" id="TOPIC_262"></a>The evidence laid before the commissioners not only showed how intolerable
the evil had become in many counties, but also how purely artificial it
was. While the aggregate amount of the poor rate had risen to more than
eight millions and a half, while some parishes were going out of
cultivation and in others the rates exceeded the rental, there were
certain oases in the desert of agricultural distress where comparative
prosperity still reigned. These were villages in which an enlightened
squire or parson had set himself to strike at the root of pauperism, and
to initiate local reforms in the poor-law system. It was clearly found
that, where out-door relief was abolished or rigorously limited, where no
allowances were made in aid of wages, and where a manly self-reliance was
encouraged instead of a servile mendicity, wages rose, honest industry
revived, and the whole<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span> character of the village population was improved.
Fortified by these successful experiments, the commissioners took a firm
stand on the vital distinction, previously ignored, between poverty and
pauperism. They did not shrink from recommending that, after a certain
date, "the workhouse test" should be enforced against all able-bodied
applicants for relief, except in the form of medical attendance, and even
that women should be compelled to support their illegitimate children.
They also advised a liberal change in the complicated and oppressive
system of "parish settlement," whereby the free circulation of labour was
constricted. They further proposed a very large reform in the
administrative machinery of the poor laws, by the formation of parishes
into unions, the concentration of workhouses, the separation of the sexes
in workhouses, and, above all, the creation of a central poor-law board,
to consist of three commissioners, and to control the whole system about
to be transformed.</p>

<p>A bill framed upon these lines, and remedying some minor abuses, was
introduced by Althorp on April 17, having been foreshadowed in the speech
from the throne, and carefully matured by the cabinet. So wide and deep
was the conviction of the necessity for some radical treatment of an
intolerable evil that party spirit was quelled for a while, and the bill
met with a very favourable reception, especially as its operation was
limited to five years. It passed the second reading by a majority of 299
to 20 on May 9, notwithstanding a violent protest from De Lacy Evans, an
ultra-radical, who had displaced Hobhouse at Westminster. The keynote of
the radical agitation which followed was given by his declaration that
"the cessation of out-door relief would lead to a revolution in the
country," and by Cobbett's denunciation of the "poor man robbery bill".
The <i>Times</i> newspaper, already a great political force, took up the same
cry, and had not Peel, with admirable public spirit, thrown his weight
into the scale of sound economy, a formidable coalition between extremists
on both sides might have been organised. He stood firm, however; radicals
like Grote declined to barter principle for popularity, and the bill
emerged almost unscathed from committee in the house of commons. It passed
its third reading on July 2 by a majority of 157 to 50. Peel's example was
followed by Wellington in the house of lords, and Brougham delivered one
of his most powerful speeches in sup<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>port of the measure. With some
modification of the bastardy clauses and other slighter amendments it was
carried by a large majority, and received the royal assent on August 4.</p>

<p>No other piece of legislation, except the repeal of the corn laws, has
done so much to rescue the working classes of Great Britain from the
misery entailed by twenty years of war. Its effect in reducing the rates
was immediate; its effect in raising the character of the agricultural
poor was not very long deferred. Happily for them, though not for the
farmers, bread was cheap for two years after it came into force. Still,
the sudden cessation of doles and pensions in aid of wages could not but
work great hardship to individuals in thousands of rural parishes, and
there was perhaps too little disposition on the part of the commissioners
to allow any temporary relaxation of the system. The rigorous enforcement
of the workhouse test, and the harsh management of workhouses, continued
for years to shock the charitable sensibilities of the public, and
actually produced some local riots. When the price of bread rose the
clamour naturally increased, and petitions multiplied until a committee
was appointed in 1837 to review the operation of the act. In the end the
committee found, as might have been expected, that, however painful the
state of transition, the change had permanently improved the condition of
the poor in England.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>QUESTION OF APPROPRIATION.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_263" id="TOPIC_263"></a>While the bill was still in the house of commons the ministry which framed
it was torn by dissensions; before it came on for its second reading in
the lords Grey had ceased to be premier. The disruption of his government
had been foreseen for months, but it was directly caused by hopeless
discord on Irish policy. Anglesey had been forced by ill-health to resign
the vice-royalty, and the Marquis Wellesley, who succeeded him, was more
acceptable to Irish nationalists. But the king's speech at the opening of
the session contained a stern condemnation of the repeal movement.
O'Connell at once declared war, and the angry feelings of his followers
were inflamed by a personal and public quarrel between Althorp and Sheil.
Another incident, in itself trivial, disclosed the discord prevailing in
the cabinet on Irish affairs, and, though O'Connell was defeated on a
motion against the union by a crushing majority of 523 to 38, the
disturbed state of Ireland continued to distract the minis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>terial
councils. The ingenious devices of Stanley and Littleton for solving the
insoluble Irish tithe question had proved almost abortive; the government
officials employed to collect tithe were almost as powerless to do so as
the old tithe-proctors, and a new proposal to convert tithe into a land
tax was naturally ridiculed by O'Connell as delusive. He made a speech so
conciliatory in its tone as to startle the house, but no words, however
smooth, could now conjure away the irreconcilable difference of purpose
between those who regarded Church property as sacred and those who
regarded it not only as at the disposal of the state, but as hitherto
unjustly monopolised by a single religious communion. It was reserved for
Lord John Russell to "upset the coach" by openly declaring his adhesion to
"appropriation," in the sense of diverting to other objects, secular or
otherwise, such revenues of the established Church as were not strictly
required for the benefit of its own members. After this act of mutiny
against the collective authority of the cabinet Grey's ministry was
doomed.</p>

<p>Its ruin was consummated by a motion of Henry Ward, member for St. Albans,
which expressly affirmed the right of the state to regulate the
distribution of Church property and the expediency of reducing the Irish
establishment. This motion was supposed to have been instigated by Durham,
who had never been loyal to his colleagues. The government was notoriously
divided upon it; Brougham suggested a commission of inquiry, by way of
compromise; other ministerialists were in favour of meeting the difficulty
by moving the previous question. Peel was prepared to support the
conservative section of the government, and deprecated in strong terms
"all man&oelig;uvring, all coquetting with radicals" in order to snatch a
temporary party triumph.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

<p>Ward's resolution was introduced on May 27, 1834, and seconded by Grote,
but Althorp, instead of replying, announced the receipt of sudden news so
important that he induced the house to adjourn the debate. This news was
the resignation of Stanley, Graham, Richmond, and Ripon, whose views on
appropriation, as afterwards appeared, were shared by Lansdowne and Spring
Rice. The ministry was reconstructed by the ac<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>cession of Lord Conyngham
as postmaster-general, without a seat in the cabinet, and of Lord
Auckland, son of Sidmouth's colleague, as first lord of the admiralty, by
the appointment of Carlisle (already in the cabinet) to be lord privy
seal, and the substitution of Spring Rice for Stanley at the colonial
office. Edward Ellice, the secretary at war, was included in the cabinet,
and James Abercromby, afterwards Lord Dunfermline, a son of the famous
general, Sir Ralph Abercromby, became master of the mint with a seat in
the cabinet. Poulett Thomson became president of the board of trade, and
minor offices were assigned to Francis Baring, and other whig recruits.
Grey himself, sick of nominal power, was dissuaded with difficulty from
retiring; Althorp, conscious of failing authority, was retained in his
post only by a high sense of duty. Unfortunately, he was very soon
entangled by his colleague Littleton in something like an intrigue with
O'Connell, which precipitated the final resignation of Grey together with
his own temporary secession.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_264" id="TOPIC_264"></a>The details of this affair may be passed over in a few words. What is
clear is that Brougham and Littleton, without the knowledge of Grey, had
persuaded Lord Wellesley, as viceroy of Ireland, not to insist on a
renewal of the coercion act in its full severity, and especially to
sanction an abandonment of clauses suppressing public meetings. Having
obtained Wellesley's consent behind the backs of Grey and the rest of the
cabinet, Littleton with the cognisance of Althorp, proceeded to bargain
with O'Connell for an abatement, at least, of his opposition to all
coercion. The cabinet as a body declined to ratify any such agreement,
O'Connell denounced Littleton as having played a trick upon him, and
Althorp, disdaining to advocate provisions which he was almost pledged in
honour to drop, resigned his office and the leadership of the commons.
Grey, who could not have remained in office without the support of
Althorp's great popularity in the commons, at once resolved to follow his
example, and on July 9 took leave of political life in a dignified and
pathetic speech. As for Ward's motion, the original cause of Grey's
desertion by Stanley and his subsequent fall, it had been rejected by an
enormous majority in favour of "the previous question" before Althorp's
disappearance from his old position. Meanwhile Stanley availed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span> himself of
his liberty to make one of his most dashing but least prudent speeches,
and permanently compromised his reputation for statesmanship.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>MELBOURNE PRIME MINISTER.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_265" id="TOPIC_265"></a>No other whig possessed the prestige derived by Grey from nearly fifty
years of consistent public service. Althorp commanded an extraordinary
degree of confidence in the house of commons and the country, but his
intellectual capacity was not of the highest order, and many expected that
Peel might receive a summons from the king, whose sympathy with the whigs,
never very deep, had given place to mistrust. His choice, however, fell
upon Melbourne, whom he desired, if possible, to form a coalition with
Peel, Wellington, and Stanley against the radicals. But neither Melbourne
nor Peel would accept such a coalition, and they both showed their wisdom
in declining it. The king then empowered Melbourne to patch up the whig
ministry. In deference to a requisition signed by liberals of all
sections, Althorp was induced to withdraw his resignation, and resumed his
leadership in the commons with no apparent diminution of popularity.
Duncannon, who was created a peer, succeeded Melbourne at the home office;
Lord Mulgrave, son of the first earl, became lord privy seal in place of
Carlisle; and Hobhouse entered the cabinet as first commissioner of woods
and forests. The rest of the session was mainly spent in discussing the
budget and the two Irish questions which for so many years were the curse
of English politics. A surplus of two millions enabled Althorp to
propitiate an importunate class of taxpayers by repealing the house tax.</p>

<p>It would have been more statesmanlike to repeal the window tax or reduce
indirect taxation, but relief was given, as usual, to those who raised the
loudest clamour, and the vindication of sound finance was reserved for a
conservative administration. A second and milder Irish coercion bill was
carried by a large majority, with the fatal proviso, which has marred the
effect of so many later measures, that it should continue in operation for
a year only. A far more serious conflict arose on the new Irish tithe
bill. A complicated plan had been proposed whereby four-fifths of the
tithe would have been ostensibly secured to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span> church by conversion into
a rent-charge, the remaining fifth being sacrificed for the sake of peace
and security. O'Connell succeeded in inducing the house of commons to
adopt a counter-plan, of a very sweeping nature, whereby two-fifths of the
existing tithe would have been abandoned, and the tithe owner partly
compensated out of the revenues of suppressed bishoprics, aided by a state
grant. The bill thus amended was rejected by a majority of 189 to 122 in
the house of lords. Peel still cherished the idea of settling the question
by a system of voluntary commutation, but, after the peremptory action of
the lords, no compromise was likely to be acceptable, and there is some
ground for the opinion that in that division the Irish Church
establishment received its death-blow.</p>

<p>On August 15 parliament was prorogued, and the belief of Peel in the
stability of the government may be inferred from the fact that he left
England for Italy on October 14. During the vacation, however, two
incidents occurred, trivial in themselves, but pregnant with important
consequences. One of these was Brougham's triumphant progress through
Scotland, where he was enthusiastically received as the saviour of his
country, and assumed the air of one who not only kept the king's
conscience but controlled the royal will. The story of this famous tour
exhibits alike the greatness of his powers and the littleness of his
character.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> The homage paid to him was not undeserved, for he was
assuredly the foremost gladiator of the whig party, and had given proofs
of more varied ability than any living politician or lawyer. But the
dignified eloquence of which he was capable on rare occasions was here
submerged in a flood of egotistical rhetoric, which carried him away so
far that he assumed a political independence which his colleagues deeply
resented, and even spoke of the king in a tone of patronage. Having
lowered himself in public opinion by these speeches, especially at
Inverness and Aberdeen, he attended a banquet in honour of Grey at
Edinburgh, where he provoked a passage at arms with Durham. The press, and
especially the <i>Times</i> newspaper, which had formerly loaded him with
extravagant praises, now turned against him, and ridiculed him as a
political mountebank. But his worst enemy was the king.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span> William IV.'s
ill-concealed impatience of whig dictation had at last been quickened into
disgust by this and other sources of irritation, when the sudden death of
Althorp's father, Earl Spencer, on November 10, gave him an opportunity
which he eagerly seized.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>DESTRUCTION OF HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_266" id="TOPIC_266"></a>By a strange fatality, this event almost coincided with the destruction by
fire of the houses of parliament on October 16. This calamity was the
result of a carelessness, which it is easy to condemn after the event on
the part of some subordinate officials and the workmen employed by them.
Down to 1826, accounts had been kept at the exchequer by means of wooden
tallies, which were stored in what was called the tally-room of the
exchequer. This room was required in order to provide temporary
accommodation for the court of bankruptcy, and an order was given to
destroy the tallies. The officials charged with the task decided to burn
them in the stoves of the house of lords, and the work of burning began at
half-past six in the morning of October 16. The work, hazardous in any
case, was conducted by the workmen with a rapidity that their orders did
not justify; the flues used for warming the house were overheated, and
though the burning of the tallies was completed between four and five, the
woodwork near the flues must have smouldered till it burst into flame
about half-past six in the evening. In less than half an hour the house of
lords was a mass of fire. About eight a change in the wind threw the
flames upon the house of commons. That house was almost completely
destroyed. The walls of the house of lords and of the painted chamber
remained standing, while the house of lords library, the parliament
offices, and Westminster Hall escaped. The king offered the parliament the
use of Buckingham Palace, but it was found possible to fit up the house of
lords for the commons and the painted chamber for the lords. When the
legislature reassembled on February 9, 1835, a conservative ministry was
in office, though not, indeed, in power.</p>

<p>It is difficult for a later age to understand why the accession of Althorp
to a peerage should have afforded even a plausible reason for a change of
ministry. The position which Althorp held in the house of commons is
puzzling to a later generation.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span> It is well known that Gladstone
recorded the very highest estimate of his public services. Yet he was not
only no orator but scarcely in the second order of speakers, he made no
pretence of far-sighted statesmanship, he was not a successful financier,
and he made several blunders which must have damaged the authority of any
other man. The influence which he obtained in leading the unreformed as
well as the reformed house of commons was entirely due to his character
for straightforward honesty, perhaps enhanced by his social rank, and his
reputation for possessing all the virtues of a country gentleman. The
national preference for amateurs over professionals in politics, no less
than in other fields of energy, found an admirable representative in him,
and he was all the more popular as a political leader because it was
believed that he had no desire to be a political leader at all. At all
events, he inspired confidence in all, and it was no mere whim of the king
which treated his removal from the commons to the lords as an irreparable
loss to Melbourne's administration.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>MELBOURNE'S RESIGNATION.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_267" id="TOPIC_267"></a>It is often stated that "without a word of preparation" the king got rid
of his whig ministers on November 14, 1834, and it must be admitted that
he afterwards took credit to himself for their dismissal as his own
personal act. But this view is not altogether borne out by contemporary
evidence. A published letter, of the 12th, from Melbourne to the king
shows that, as premier, he took the initiative in representing that,
whereas "the government in its present form was mainly founded upon the
personal weight and influence possessed by Earl Spencer in the house of
commons," it was for the king to consider whether, as "that foundation is
now withdrawn," a change of ministry was expedient.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> It also appears
from a letter placed by the king in Melbourne's hands that a "very
confidential conversation" took place between them at Brighton, in
consequence of which the king resolved to send for Wellington.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> In the
course of this conversation Melbourne informed the king that, in the
opinion of the cabinet, Lord John Russell should be selected for the
leadership of the house of commons. The king, incensed by Lord John's
action on the Irish Church question, would not hear of this arrangement,
espe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>cially as he thought Lord John "otherwise unequal to the task," and
disparaged the claims of other possible candidates.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> He also strongly
resented the recent conduct of Brougham. In the end, he parted kindly and
courteously from Melbourne, who actually undertook to convey the king's
summons to Wellington. Another memorandum by the king, of the same date,
proves that a fear of further encroachments on the church was really
uppermost in his mind, and that he anticipated, not without reason, "a
schism in the cabinet" on this very subject.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_268" id="TOPIC_268"></a>Wellington acted with his customary promptitude, and with his customary
obedience to what he regarded as a call of public duty. A certain degree
of mistrust had existed between him and Peel, arising, in part, out of
circumstances preceding the duke's election to the chancellorship of
Oxford University. This suspension of cordiality had now passed away, and
Wellington strongly urged the king to entrust Peel, then at Rome, with the
formation of a new government. Hudson, afterwards known as Sir James
Hudson, delivered the despatch recalling him on the night of the 25th.
Peel started from Rome on the 26th and, travelling with a speed then
considered marvellous, reached Dover within twelve days on the night of
December 8. He was in London on the 9th, and, without consulting any one
else, immediately placed his services at the king's disposal. In the
meantime, Wellington had stepped into the gap, and actually held all the
secretaryships of state in his own hands, pending the arrival of Peel.</p>

<p>The king had been encouraged to hustle his ministers unceremoniously out
of office by a paragraph which appeared in the <i>Times</i> of November 15. On
the previous evening Brougham had been informed by Melbourne in confidence
that the king had accepted his suggestion of resignation, and he carried
the news to the <i>Times</i>, which, without giving Brougham's name, published
his message in his own words. It stated that the king had turned out the
ministry, and ended with the words: "The queen has done it all". After
this the king was determined to be done with his ministers as quickly as
possible. It is certain that neither Wellington nor Peel wished to be
thought responsible for their dismissal, the propriety of which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span> they both
secretly doubted. The king, however, had acted within his strict rights,
and the outgoing ministers, as a whole, were not ill pleased to be
relieved from the burdens of office.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_269" id="TOPIC_269"></a>Peel, though by no means hopeful of ultimate success, endeavoured to
construct a cabinet on a comprehensive basis. He first obtained the king's
"ready assent" to his inviting the co-operation of Stanley, who had
succeeded to the courtesy title of Lord Stanley, and Sir James Graham.
These overtures were declined in friendly terms, and both promised
independent support. But Stanley explicitly declared that, in his
judgment, "the sudden conversion of long political opposition into the
most intimate alliance would shock public opinion, would be ruinous to his
own character," and would rather injure than strengthen the new
government.<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> After this failure, Peel felt his task well-nigh
hopeless, and though he spared no effort to procure an infusion of fresh
blood, he complained that after all "it would be only the duke's old
cabinet".<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> There was, in fact, no man of known ability in it, except
himself, the Duke of Wellington (as secretary for foreign affairs), and
Lyndhurst, the chancellor; for the capacity of Aberdeen, who had been
foreign secretary under Wellington, and who now became secretary for war
and the colonies, and Ellenborough, who returned to the board of control,
had not yet been generally recognised. Peel himself became first lord of
the treasury and chancellor of the exchequer; Goulburn was home secretary,
Rosslyn lord president, and Wharncliffe lord privy seal. Earl de Grey,
elder brother of the Earl of Ripon, was made first lord of the admiralty,
Murray became master-general of the ordnance, Alexander Baring president
of the board of trade and master of the mint, Herries secretary at war,
and Sir Edward Knatchbull paymaster of the forces. It was fully understood
that a conservative government, even purged of ultra-tory elements, could
not face the first reformed house of commons, and the dissolution which
took place at the end of the year had been regarded by all as inevitable.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE TAMWORTH MANIFESTO.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_270" id="TOPIC_270"></a>In anticipation of this event, Peel issued an address to his constituents
which became celebrated as the "Tamworth manifesto". It is somewhat
cumbrous in style, but it embodies with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span> sufficient clearness the new
conservative policy of which Peel was the real author and henceforth the
leading exponent. It opens with an appeal to his own previous conduct in
parliament, as showing that, while he was no apostate from old
constitutional principles, neither was he "a defender of abuses," nor the
enemy of "judicious reforms". In proof of this, he cites his action in
regard to the currency and various amendments of the law; to which he
might have added his adoption of catholic emancipation. He then declares,
absolutely and without reserve, that he accepts the reform act as "a final
and irrevocable settlement of a great constitutional question," which no
friend to peace and the welfare of the country would seek, either directly
or indirectly, to disturb. He approves of making "a careful review of
institutions, civil and ecclesiastical, undertaken in a friendly temper,"
with a view to "the correction of proved abuses, and the redress of real
grievances," and that "without mere superstitious reverence for ancient
usages". He lays stress on his recorded assent to the principle of
corporation reform, the substitution of a treasury grant for Church rates,
the relief of dissenters from various civil disabilities (but not from
university tests), the restriction of pensions (saving vested interests),
the redistribution of Church revenues and the commutation of tithes, but
so that no ecclesiastical property be diverted to secular uses. After
these specific pledges, the Tamworth manifesto concludes with more general
professions of a progressive conservatism equally removed from what are
now called "advanced radicalism" and "tory democracy".<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> It was, of
course, too liberal for the followers of Eldon, and was ridiculed as
colourless by extreme reformers, but its effect on the country was great,
and it did much to win popular confidence for the new ministry. If such a
policy must be called opportunism, it was opportunism in its best form;
and opportunism in its best form, under the conditions of party
government, is not far removed from political wisdom.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII"></a>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>

<h3>PEEL AND MELBOURNE.</h3>


<p><a name="TOPIC_271" id="TOPIC_271"></a>The general election which took place in January, 1835, was hotly
contested, and in the second reformed parliament the conservatives
mustered far stronger than in the first. The party now consisted of some
270 members, chiefly returned by the counties. But they were still
outnumbered by the whigs, radicals, and Irish repealers combined, and it
was certain that an occasion for such a combination would soon arise. It
was found at once in the election of a speaker, when the house of commons
met on February 9, 1835. Sutton, now Sir Charles Manners Sutton, was
proposed for re-election by the government; the opposition candidate was
Abercromby. <a name="TOPIC_272" id="TOPIC_272"></a>The number of members who took part in the division was the
largest ever assembled, being 622, and Abercromby was elected by a
majority of ten. It would have been larger, had not the government been
supported by some waverers, but its significance was appreciated by the
ministers, and still more by the king. He expressed his displeasure in a
very outspoken letter to Peel, declaring that, if the leaders "of the
present factious opposition" should be forced upon him by a refusal of the
supplies, he might, indeed, tolerate them, but could never give them his
confidence or friendship. Two days later, the 24th, the king's speech was
delivered, reflecting the spirit of the Tamworth manifesto.<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>PEEL'S POLICY.</i></div>

<p>The government was again defeated by seven on an amendment to the address,
notwithstanding the loyal aid of Graham and Stanley, whose attitude during
the general election had excited Peel's mistrust. In the course of this
debate, the prime minister, abandoning his usual reserve, definitely
pledged himself not only "to advance, soberly and cautiously, in the path
of pro<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>gressive improvement," but to bring forward specific measures. "I
offer you," he said, "reduced estimates, improvements in civil
jurisprudence, reform of ecclesiastical law, the settlement of the tithe
question in Ireland, the commutation of tithe in England, the removal of
any real abuse in the Church, the redress of those grievances of which the
dissenters have any just ground to complain." Nor were these offers
illusory or barren. On March 17, he brought in a bill to relieve
dissenters from disabilities in respect of marriage, which met with
general approval. It was founded on the simple principle, since adopted,
of giving legal validity to civil marriages duly solemnised before a
registrar, and leaving each communion to superadd a religious sanction in
its own way. The marriages of Churchmen in a church were to be left on
their old footing, but Churchmen were of course to be granted the same
liberty as other citizens of contracting a purely civil marriage.</p>

<p>Still more important, as examples of conservative reform, were Peel's
efforts to purge the established Church of abuses, and to introduce a
voluntary commutation of tithes. His correspondence amply shows how large
a space these remedial measures occupied in his mind, and one of his first
acts was to appoint an ecclesiastical commission, with instructions to
institute a most comprehensive inquiry into every subject affecting the
distribution of church revenues. Compared with the petty squabbles over
the appropriation of an imaginary surplus to be derived from Irish tithes
which it was impossible to collect, the schemes of Peel for purifying and
strengthening the Church of England assume heroic proportions. The report
of the ecclesiastical commission originated by him, with its startling
disclosures of pluralism and non-residence, became the basis of
legislation which has wrought a veritable revolution in the financial and
disciplinary administration of the church. His tithe bill, abortive as it
was in 1835, was reproduced, with little alteration, in the tithe
commutation act of 1836.</p>

<p>But the whig-radical allies of 1835 had not the smallest intention of
giving Peel a fair trial; nor indeed had they any other object beyond the
recovery of power. His appeals to his opponents, though by no means
without effect in the country, fell upon deaf ears in the house of
commons, and further humiliations followed rapidly. One of these was the
successful outcry<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span> against the appointment of Londonderry, who had excited
much hostility as an uncompromising enemy to reform, to the embassy at St.
Petersburg, in consequence of which he, very honourably, relieved the
government from obloquy by declining the post. A motion to repeal the malt
tax was decisively defeated, and soon afterwards a motion in favour of
granting a charter to the University of London was carried against the
government by a large majority. Then came a defeat on a motion for
adjournment, and the arts of obstruction were obstinately practised in
debates on the estimates. At last the inevitable crisis arrived, and, as
might be expected, the final issue was taken upon an Irish question.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_273" id="TOPIC_273"></a>The influence of O'Connell and his "tail," as his followers were called,
had been neutralised, since the reform act, by the overwhelming strength
of the whigs, and the public-spirited action of Peel, who, as leader of
the conservative opposition, actually supported the whig government in
sixteen out of twenty most important contests on domestic policy. A very
different spirit was now shown by the whig opposition, and an evil
precedent, pregnant with disastrous consequences, was set by the famous
"Lichfield House compact". This was a close alliance between O'Connell and
those whom he had so fiercely denounced as "the base, brutal, and bloody
whigs". It bore immediate fruit in a motion of Russell for a committee of
the whole house to consider the temporalities of the Irish Church. After a
debate of four nights, the resolution was carried, on March 30, by a
majority of thirty-three. On April 5, a further resolution was carried by
a majority of twenty-five for applying any surplus-funds "to the general
education of all classes of the people without religious distinction," and
was more emphatically affirmed two days later by a majority of
twenty-seven.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_274" id="TOPIC_274"></a>Peel had long been conscious of the hopelessness of his position and
impatient of maintaining the struggle. He felt the constitutional danger
of allowing the executive government to become a helpless instrument in
the hands of a hostile majority in the house of commons. Nothing but the
earnest remonstrances of the king and his tory friends, including
Wellington, had induced him to retain office so long, and, after the
division of the 7th, he firmly resolved to resign. On doing so, he
received from the whole conservative party, of which he was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span> the creator,
a most cordial address of thanks and confidence. Though his short
administration had consolidated the whig forces for the moment, and given
them a new lease of power, it showed him to be the foremost statesman in
the country, and paved the way for his triumphant return to office. As
Guizot said, he had proved himself "the most liberal of conservatives, the
most conservative of liberals, and the most capable man of all in both
parties".</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>MELBOURNE'S SECOND MINISTRY.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_275" id="TOPIC_275"></a>The king now discovered the fatal mistake which he had made in
"dismissing" his whig cabinet, as he boasted, instead of waiting for it to
break down under the stress of internal dissensions. His first idea was to
fall back on Grey, who had already betrayed his growing mistrust of
radicalism, but Grey declined to enter the lists again. There was no
resource but to recall Melbourne, whom the king personally liked, and to
put up with the elevation of Russell to a position which all admitted him
to have fairly earned. He became home secretary, as well as leader of the
house of commons, and the new whig cabinet differed little from the old.
Palmerston, Lansdowne, Auckland, Thompson, and Holland returned to their
former offices. Grant was made secretary for war and the colonies,
Duncannon became lord privy seal, Spring Rice chancellor of the exchequer,
Hobhouse president of the board of control, and Viscount Howick, son of
Earl Grey, was appointed secretary at war. Outside the cabinet, Viscount
Morpeth, son of the Earl of Carlisle, became Irish secretary. The most
significant difference between the two cabinets lay in the omission of
Brougham, which was effected by the expedient of placing the great seal in
commission. This negative act was, in reality, the boldest and most
perilous in Melbourne's political life. A correspondence between Brougham
and Melbourne in February must have made clear to the ex-chancellor that
he would be excluded from office, and he reluctantly acquiesced in
Melbourne's decision, hoping that it would be merely temporary, and that
he would soon resume his place on the woolsack as the dominant member of
the cabinet, but his exclusion was destined to be final, and the close of
a career to which English history in the nineteenth century presents no
parallel.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>BROUGHAM.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_276" id="TOPIC_276"></a>Brougham was called to the Scottish bar at the age of twenty-one, having
already given proof of brilliant ability and rare versatility at the
University of Edinburgh. He was the youngest and most prolific of the
original writers in the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>, then a very powerful organ of
whig opinion, and his contributions to it ranged over some thirty years
after its first appearance in 1802. He was already twenty-nine when he
joined the English bar in 1808, and though he never rivalled Eldon as a
lawyer or Scarlett as a persuasive advocate, he soon became an
acknowledged master of the highest forensic eloquence. His fame was
already established by his argument before parliament against the orders
in council when he entered the house of commons in 1810. There his
passionate oratory and power of invective made him the most formidable of
party speakers, and it was said that Canning alone could face him on equal
terms in debate. Except during four years, 1812-16, when he was out of
parliament, his prodigious energy and versatility were the greatest
intellectual force on the liberal side throughout all the political
conflicts under the regency and the reign of George IV. His speeches
embraced every question of foreign, colonial, or domestic policy, and it
may truly be said that no salutary reform was carried during that period
of which he was not either the author or the active promoter. The
suppression of the slave-trade which had revived after the great war, the
liberty of the press, the cause of popular education&mdash;these were among the
almost innumerable objects, outside the common run of politics, and
largely philanthropic, to which he devoted his restless mind, before it
was engrossed for a while by parliamentary reform. There, as we have seen,
he showed a moderation which had not been expected of him, nor is it too
much to say that, both as a leader of the bar and as chancellor, he made
good his claim to be the greatest of law reformers.</p>

<p>His famous speech of February 7, 1828, had quickened the germs of many
legal improvements carried out in a later age, and the four years of his
chancellorship actually produced great constructive amendments of the law,
such as the institution of the central criminal court and the judicial
committee of the privy council. Other reforms, in bankruptcy, criminal
law, and equity, were mainly due to his initiative, and it was he who
originated the county courts, though his bill was reck<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>lessly thrown out
by the house of lords on party grounds. His public life, up to the year
1835, was perhaps the most brilliant and the most useful of the century,
yet it was hopelessly marred in the end by a certain eccentric vanity, and
want of loyalty to colleagues, not inconsistent with the higher ambition
of leaving the world better than he found it. For some years after his
fall he retained his astounding energy, and even his ascendency in the
house of lords, where Lyndhurst, his only possible rival, was astute
enough to court his co-operation. Never was his fertility in debate more
conspicuously shown than in the session of 1835, while he was still
nominally a supporter of the whig government. The last stage of his life,
extending over more than thirty years, belongs to another chapter of
English history; it is enough here to notice that, whatever his political
aberrations, he continued in his isolation and old age to work zealously
for those social reforms which he sincerely had at heart. The popularity
which had been to him as the breath of life never, indeed, returned to
him, and his figure no longer occupies a foremost place in the gallery of
our statesmen, but the results of his noble services to humanity remain,
and the memory of them ought not to be obscured by the sad record of his
failings.</p>

<p>The new Melbourne administration came in with unfavourable omens. Russell
failed to secure his re-election in South Devon, but a seat was found for
him at Stroud, and though the premier emphatically denied that he had made
any bargain with O'Connell, the Irish people believed it. Accordingly,
they received the whig lord-lieutenant, Mulgrave, with a tumultuous
procession, as if his advent portended the repeal of the union and
extinction of tithes. An attempt to solve the insoluble tithe question
was, in fact, among the earliest efforts of the government, and Morpeth,
as chief secretary, introduced a very reasonable measure, differing
little, except in details, from that of his predecessor. Like other
proposals for agrarian settlements in Ireland, it involved a certain
sacrifice on the part of the tithe-owner for the sake of security, and a
subsidy from the state to relieve of arrears the defaulting and rebellious
tithe-payers. Peel stated his intention of supporting these provisions for
commutation, if they could be separated from other provisions for
"appropriation," coupled with them under the influ<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>ence of political
necessity rather than of sound policy. The proposals for appropriation
were so moderate that little would have been lost by dropping or gained by
carrying them, but, moderate as they were, they embodied a principle on
which either party was resolved to stand or fall. The consequence might
have been foreseen. The bill, as a whole, was passed in the house of
commons, and even read a second time in the house of lords, after which
the appropriation clauses were rejected in that assembly by a large
majority. Thereupon Melbourne withdrew the scheme altogether. Thus a
question of third-rate importance, having been the chronic difficulty of
four Irish secretaries, was left to stand over for three years longer, and
ultimately to be settled on the very basis which Stanley and Peel had
accepted from the first. A greater waste of parliamentary time has perhaps
never been recorded.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>MUNICIPAL CORPORATIONS BILL.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_277" id="TOPIC_277"></a>The session of 1835, however, was rendered memorable by the enactment of
one beneficent measure of the first magnitude. This measure&mdash;the municipal
corporations act&mdash;was preceded, like the new poor law, by a thorough and
exhaustive inquiry. A committee of the house of commons, followed by a
commission, had been appointed in 1833. The commission prosecuted careful
researches into the local conditions of each municipality, and did not
conclude its labours until 1835. Its report laid bare not merely grotesque
anomalies, but the grossest abuses of election and administration in
boroughs ruled by small, corrupt, and irresponsible oligarchies which then
abounded in England, and, still more, in Scotland.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> The reform act had
paved the way for the purification of such urban communities, by
disfranchising the smallest and most venal of them, by extending the
boundaries of many others, by enfranchising great towns which had remained
outside the pale of representation, and by conferring the suffrage,
theretofore monopolised by freemen and other privileged classes, on the
unprivileged mass of ten-pound householders.</p>

<p>The municipal corporations bill, in its ultimate form, rested<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span> on the same
broad lines of policy. It imposed upon all boroughs, with the exception of
the city of London and a few of minor importance, one constitutional form
of government, identical in all its essential features with those which a
few model boroughs already possessed. The governing body was to consist of
a mayor, aldermen, and councillors, together forming a town council. The
councillors were to be elected directly by ratepaying occupiers, with a
saving for the prescriptive rights of existing freemen. They were to hold
office for three years; the aldermen were to be elected by the councillors
for six years, with a provision for retirement by rotation. The mayor was
to be elected annually by the town council. The elementary powers of local
government, such as the control of lighting and the constabulary force,
were to be transferred (subject to certain exceptions) from the hands of
committees into those of the one recognised and supreme municipal
authority. Other clauses provided for a division of the larger boroughs
into wards, for the abolition of exclusive trading privileges, for the
public management of charity estates, and for the appointment, at the
option of each borough, of a recorder, for the purposes of jurisdiction.</p>

<p>Such were the main outlines of the great measure introduced by Russell, to
which Peel heartily gave his adhesion. It was a natural, and almost
necessary, sequel of the reform act, which had already broken up many
nests of jobbery, curtailed the lucrative exercise of the elective
franchise by freemen, and undermined the influence of those self-elected
rulers who, in the worst boroughs, had become gangs of public thieves.
Supported by Peel, the bill was read a second time in the house of
commons, on June 15, without a division. Several conservative amendments
were defeated in committee by small majorities, and the bill was sent up
to the lords on July 21. There its fate was far different. Though
Wellington himself was not disposed to obstruct it, he entirely failed to
check the obstructive tactics of Lyndhurst who, on this occasion, outdid
himself in the deliberate mutilation of a bill approved by the late
conservative premier. Lord Campbell, no partial judge of Brougham, has
left on record his belief that, but for his faithful and vigorous support,
the scheme of municipal reform must have been utterly wrecked.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> It was
allowed to be read a second time, but with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span> the full concurrence of Eldon
and all the ultra-tory peers, Lyndhurst succeeded in pulling it to pieces
in committee. For instance, one of the amendments imported into it
perpetuated proprietary rights which it was a chief object of the bill to
abolish; another gave aldermen a life-tenure of their offices; a third
retained a part of the old town councillors on the new town councils.
Proud as he was of his destructive exploits, as a triumph of toryism over
conservatism, Lyndhurst soon found that he could not so lightly override
the wiser counsels of Peel. When the lords' amendments came to be
considered in the commons, Russell prudently advised the acceptance of the
less important, and the disallowance of those inconsistent with the
principle of the bill. He was followed by Peel who, professing to uphold
the independence of the upper house, declared against the more obnoxious
amendments, and stickled only for points which the ministry was not
unwilling to concede. His action proved decisive. The commons stood firm
on the main issues, and the hostile party in the lords, who had vowed to
mar this reform, flinched at the last moment. Many of them abstained from
attendance. Wellington and even Lyndhurst recommended concession;
conferences took place between the houses, at which Russell played the
part of moderator, and on September 9 the corporation bill became law, not
in its entirety, but in all its essential features.</p>

<p>In spite of this pacific compromise, popular feeling ran higher than ever
against the house of lords which, under the evil influence of Lyndhurst,
seemed bent on thwarting every liberal measure. John Roebuck, member for
Bath, a prominent radical, who acted independently of party connexions,
took a lead in denouncing their conduct, and went so far as to propose
giving them a merely suspensory, instead of an absolute, veto on
legislation. A sweeping reform in their constitution was loudly advocated
in the press. O'Connell, exasperated by their wanton rejection of a Dublin
police bill, spent a part of the parliamentary recess in a tour over the
north of England and Scotland, exhausting the stores of his scurrilous
invective in pouring contempt on the 170 tyrants who could dare to
withstand the will of the people. But O'Connell's eloquence, marvellous as
it was, never stirred British audiences as it stirred the Irish masses,
and it happened that at this moment he was somewhat discredited<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span> by
accusations of corruption afterwards proved to be false. The house of
lords not only survived his attacks, but was instigated by Lyndhurst to
further acts of obstruction in the following year.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>COTTENHAM, LORD CHANCELLOR.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_278" id="TOPIC_278"></a>His most powerful opponent was about to disappear from the political
scenes for the present, and in the future to be converted into an ally.
When the great seal was entrusted to commissioners, Brougham had affected
to regard the arrangement as a temporary makeshift to propitiate William
IV., and hoped that he would inherit the reversion of the chancellorship.
With this expectation he not only patronised but warmly supported the whig
ministry in 1835. But his wayward and petulant egotism had set all his old
colleagues against him, and Melbourne had made up his mind that "it was
impossible to act with him". The interruption of legal business caused by
the constant withdrawal of three judges from their proper duties, to act
as commissioners, was severely criticised by the press, and Sir Edward
Sugden, who had been lord chancellor of Ireland under Peel, published an
effective pamphlet entitled, "What has become of the great seal?" It was
thought necessary to appoint a new chancellor, and in January, 1836, Sir
Charles Pepys, then master of the rolls, was raised to that dignity as
Lord Cottenham. Foreseeing the implacable indignation of Brougham, the
ministry decided to confer a peerage on Henry Bickersteth, the new master
of the rolls, who became Lord Langdale, and who was supposed capable of
confronting the ex-chancellor in debate. No expectation could have been
more unfounded or delusive, but the sense of disappointment and desertion
so preyed on the health and nerves of Brougham that he forsook the house
of lords for a whole session. Campbell does not shrink from saying that he
was "atrociously ill-used" on this occasion,<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> and assuredly he should
not have been left to learn from a newspaper that he was thrust aside in
favour of a man of vastly inferior gifts and services.</p>

<p>One other change was made in the cabinet during the recess. The Earl of
Minto became first lord of the admiralty in succession to Auckland who had
been appointed governor-general of India. When parliament met on February
4, 1836, the prospects of the whig government were more favourable than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
on their first accession to office. The factious conduct of the house of
lords in the last session had disgusted the country, while the
statesmanlike moderation of Peel secured them fair-play in the house of
commons, though it was gradually building up a strong conservative party.
Ireland again blocked the way for a while against useful legislation for
Great Britain, and the first encounter of parties was on an amendment to
the address condemning the anticipated reform of Irish corporations on the
principles already adopted for England. This amendment, unwillingly moved
by Peel, was defeated by a majority of forty-one, and the Irish municipal
bill was introduced on the 16th. Like its English prototype, it was
founded on the report of a commission which had disclosed the grossest
possible abuses in Irish municipalities, chiefly dominated by protestant
oligarchies. A similar measure substituting elective councils for these
corrupt bodies had actually passed its third reading in the commons before
the end of the last session, but the attempt to carry it further was then
abandoned. The debates on the bill of 1836 for the same purpose inevitably
turned on broad issues which continued to disturb Irish politics and to
perplex English statesmen for the rest of the century. On the one hand, no
one could justify "government by ascendency" in Ireland, or the shameful
malpractices incident to an exercise of power under no sense of
responsibility. On the other hand, no one acquainted with Irish history
and Irish character could honestly regard the people as yet qualified for
local self-government. In the social and some of the moral virtues they
might be favourably compared with Englishmen and Scotchmen; in the
political virtues, upon which civil institutions must rest, they were
several generations behind their fellow-subjects in Great Britain.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>IRISH BILLS.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_279" id="TOPIC_279"></a>All were agreed on the necessity of sweeping away or expurgating the
existing Irish corporations, but the whole strength of the conservative
party in both houses was enlisted against the experiment of elective town
councils, especially after the evidence lately taken before the so-called
"intimidation committee" in the house of commons. Peel's scheme was to
vest the executive powers and property of Irish corporations, at least for
the present, in officers appointed by the crown. An amendment framed in
this sense was defeated by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span> a large majority, and the bill passed the
commons with little further opposition. When it reached the lords it was
stoutly contested by Lyndhurst, now fortified by Peel's concurrence, on
the not unreasonable ground that it would make the radicals and repealers
predominant in every Irish municipality, and create "seats of agitation"
for revolutionary purposes in the new town councils. Being converted into
a bill "for the abolition of municipal corporations" in Ireland, it was
returned in that form to the house of commons. Russell vainly attempted to
meet the lords half-way by another compromise, and the measure was
abandoned only to be adopted, in a very modified shape, after the lapse of
four years. A like course was pursued by the upper house when a new Irish
tithe bill, with an appropriation clause, was sent up to them. Had the
whig government been well advised they would scarcely have challenged a
needless collision between the two houses by reviving this burning
question so early. It would have been possible to settle the Irish tithe
system on equitable lines, without prejudicing the future application of
superfluous Church revenues, and it was a somewhat perverse obstinacy
which persisted in coupling the two objects year after year. The ingenuity
of Lyndhurst in wrecking sound reforms should have been left without
excuse; whereas, in this case, the peers could not have accepted what they
regarded as a confiscation bill without a sacrifice of conviction and
self-respect.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_280" id="TOPIC_280"></a>Happily the commutation of tithes in England presented no political
difficulties of the same nature. The payment of tithes in kind, though
founded on immemorial usage, had, indeed, produced constant discord
between the parish clergyman and his flock, while landlords and farmers
justly complained that it impeded the improvement of agriculture. In many
localities the pressure of these evils had led to voluntary compositions
between tithe-owners and tithe-payers, which, being temporary, lacked the
force of law. The permissive tithe bills of Althorp and Peel were designed
to render general a practice which already prevailed in a thousand
parishes, and that now introduced by Russell was little more than an
extension of the same principle. Its mainspring was the appointment of
commissioners with compulsory powers in the last resort, and the provision
of a self-acting machinery for assessing the reduced annual rent charge<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
payable in lieu of tithes, so as to vary with the average price of wheat,
barley, and oats in the seven preceding years. This practical solution of
the question was adopted cheerfully by the wearied legislature, and the
commissioners succeeded before long in effecting universal commutation.
Amendments in detail have of course been found necessary, but the system
established by 6 and 7 William IV., cap. 61, has stood the test of long
experience, and although tithe-owners have been impoverished by the fall
of prices, the payment of tithes in England has ceased to be a grievance,
except with those who absolutely condemn the endowment of a Church.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>REGISTRATION ACTS.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_281" id="TOPIC_281"></a>An equally valuable and permanent legacy of this session is contained in
two cognate acts regulating marriages and registration in England. By the
first of these acts two new modes of celebrating marriage were provided,
without interfering with the old privileges of the established Church in
regard to marriage by licence or banns. While the essential conditions of
notice and publicity were carefully secured, the superintendent registrar
of each district was empowered either to authorise the celebration of
marriage in a duly registered place of worship, but in presence of a
district registrar, or to solemnise the ceremony himself, without any
religious service, in his own office. Clergymen of the Church of England
were constituted registrars for marriages celebrated by themselves, and
were bound to furnish the superintendent registrars with certified entries
of such marriages. The act was complicated by a variety of safeguards,
enforced by heavy penalties, against fraud and evasion, but its leading
features were simple and have proved effectual for their purpose. It
marked an advance on the earlier marriage bill of Russell, since it not
only allowed dissenters to marry in their own chapels, but to marry
without having their banns published in the parish church. It went beyond
the marriage bill of Peel, since it not only recognised marriage as a
civil contract, but utilised the new poor law organisation, and posted in
each district a civil official before whom that contract could legally be
solemnised.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_282" id="TOPIC_282"></a>The rules laid down by the first act for the registration of marriages
were an integral part of a general registration system established by the
second act, and embracing births and deaths as well as marriages. This
system, rendered possible by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span> division of the country into unions,
brought under effective control the old parochial registers which had been
loosely kept for three centuries. The statistical value of the returns
thus checked and digested in a central department is now fully recognised,
but can only be appreciated by students of social history, which, indeed,
is now largely founded on reports of the registrar-general. The special
provisions for the registration of deaths are also of the utmost service
in the prevention of disease and crime. Not until after this act of 1836
was it realised by the mass of the people, not only that a sudden death
would properly be followed by a coroner's inquest, but that every death,
with its circumstances, must be treated as a matter of public concern and
duly notified. Still more important in its results has been the
requirement of a medical statement on the cause of death&mdash;a requirement
which has brought about the discovery of numerous murders and greatly
checked the commission of others. If the marriage act relieved a large
class of the community from vexatious disabilities, the whole community
assuredly owes the second reformed parliament a debt of gratitude for the
registration act which, like so many of the best acts in the statute book,
provoked but little discussion.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_283" id="TOPIC_283"></a>A far keener party interest was excited by the crusade against the Orange
lodges in Great Britain and Ireland which Hume and Finn, an Irish member,
carried on with great energy in the sessions of 1835 and 1836. These
societies then had an importance which they no longer possess, and were
the more open to radical attacks because the Duke of Cumberland was grand
master of the order. It was said, with some justice, that while the
catholic association was nominally put down, the Orange lodges in Ireland
were openly spreading, with the connivance at least of the Irish
authorities. Their officials included noblemen of high position; Goulburn,
when chief secretary, was an Orangeman, and special efforts had been made
to enrol members in the army. Their principles were strictly loyal, but
their demonstrations were naturally resented by the Roman catholics, and
were not far removed from preparations for civil war. They hailed the
accession of Peel's short ministry with tumultuous enthusiasm, but when
the legality of their organisation and proceedings was challenged<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span> in the
house of commons, during the session of 1835, their advocates felt
compelled to support a committee of inquiry. The evidence taken before
this committee, and the debate raised by Hume on the formation of Orange
lodges in the army, damaged their cause in the eyes of the public, and
seriously compromised the Duke of Cumberland. It was shown that his
brother, the Duke of York, had resigned the grand mastership, and on being
convinced of their illegality had forbidden Orange lodges in the army,
whereas the Duke of Cumberland had accepted the grand mastership and
directly promoted military lodges.</p>

<p>An address condemning them was carried; the king undertook to discourage
them, and the commander-in-chief issued a stringent order for their
suppression. The struggle, however, was continued by the pertinacity of
the radicals in demanding a more extended inquiry, and the obstinacy of
the Orangemen in defying both the house of commons and the horse guards.
Early in the session of 1836 Finn and Hume renewed their assaults, and the
latter moved for an address, to be framed in the most sweeping terms, and
calling upon the crown to dismiss all persons in public employment, from
the highest to the lowest, who should belong to Orange societies. Russell,
who had been gradually rising in public estimation, showed the qualities
of a true statesman on this occasion by a firm yet conciliatory speech
which commanded assent on both sides. He exposed the extravagant and
impracticable nature of Hume's demand, but condemned the Orange societies,
and proposed an address urging the crown to use its influence for "the
effectual discouragement of Orange lodges, and generally all political
societies, excluding persons of different faith, using signs and symbols,
and acting by associated branches". This resolution was adopted without
opposition, the king heartily endorsed it, even the Duke of Cumberland
acquiesced in it, and the Orange societies quietly dissolved themselves,
for a while, throughout the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>If the session of 1836 had produced no other legislative fruits it could
not be regarded as wasted. But several minor reforms of great social
benefit also date from this year, and prove that, however checked by
political blunders, the energy kindled by the reform act had not yet
exhausted itself. After repeated efforts of legal philanthropists, a bill
was now passed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span> for the first time allowing prisoners on trial for felony
to be defended by counsel. It was brought in by William Ewart, a private
member, who sat for Liverpool, but was supported by the highest legal
authorities in the house of lords, including Lyndhurst himself, who openly
recanted his former opinions, and declared the old law to be a barbarous
survival, inconsistent with the practice of other civilised nations. In
the same house an interesting debate took place on the management of
jails, which had been placed under a system of inspection by an act of the
previous year. The reports of the inspectors disclosed gross abuses, not
only in the smaller county jails but in Newgate itself. Lansdowne, in
pledging the government to deal with the larger question, intimated that
Russell, as home secretary, was considering the means of separating
juvenile offenders from hardened criminals by establishing places of
detention in the nature of what have since been known as reformatories.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>DUTY ON NEWSPAPERS LOWERED.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_284" id="TOPIC_284"></a>A still more notable contribution to social improvement was made by Spring
Rice, the chancellor of the exchequer, in consolidating the paper duties
on a reduced scale, and lowering the stamp duty on newspapers from
fourpence to one penny. These were the only controversial elements in a
budget otherwise modest and acceptable. The battle over paper duties and
"taxes upon knowledge" raised in the debates of 1836 was destined to rage
many years longer, but the relief granted by Spring Rice gave a powerful
impulse to journalism and periodical literature. It was opposed by all the
familiar arguments against a cheap press, but that which most endangered
its success was a rival proposal to apply any surplus revenue to
cheapening soap. Soap, it was plausibly contended, was a necessary,
reading newspapers or periodicals was only a luxury, and a luxury, too,
far move capable of being abused than expenditure on soap. When the penny
stamp on newspapers was at last preferred to reduced soap duties it was
said that, "so far as financial arrangements were concerned, everything
went to supply the essential elements of low political clubs, <i>viz.</i>,
cheap gin, cheap newspapers, filthy hands, and unwashed faces".<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></p>

<p>The legislative record of 1836 was creditable to the government, nor was
the action of the upper house in amending<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span> certain of their bills so
purely mischievous as it has been described. For instance, a strange
clause had found its way into the newspaper stamp bill, requiring all the
proprietors of newspapers, however numerous, to be registered at the stamp
office. This clause was struck out in the house of lords, at the instance
of Lyndhurst, though Melbourne declared it to be a vital part of the
measure, which, however, passed without it, and was the better for the
loss of it. But the same cannot be said of Lyndhurst's conduct at the
"open conference" between the two houses on a supplementary bill for
remedying defects in the operation of the municipal corporations act.
There no question of principle was involved, and the only motive for
resisting every attempt to improve the new machinery already established
by law was one unworthy of a statesman. At the close of the session,
Lyndhurst delivered a masterly vindication of his own proceedings, but he
was answered by Melbourne in a speech of great ability, and the position
now occupied by the whigs appeared stronger than when they came into
office in 1835.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_285" id="TOPIC_285"></a>In this year complaints of agricultural distress once more became urgent,
and a committee was appointed by the house of commons, as in 1833, to
inquire into its cause. Strange to say, the immediate occasion for the
second inquiry was the occurrence of three magnificent harvests in
succession, which brought down the average price of wheat from 58s. 8d. in
1832 to 53s. in 1833, 46s. 2d. in 1834, and 39s. 4d. in 1835, whence it
rose to 48s. 6d. after the harvest of 1836. The average gazette price of
1835 was the lowest touched in the nineteenth century until 1884, and was
simply due to excess of production. It was stated before the committee of
1836, by the comptroller of corn returns, that in the period between 1814
and 1834 the quantity of home-grown wheat only fell short of the
consumption, on the average, by about 1,000,000 quarters a year, of which
at least half was contributed by Ireland. The committee published its
evidence without making a report, but this fact is highly significant as
marking the later revolution in British agriculture. If the area then
devoted to wheat crops almost sufficed to feed an estimated population of
14,500,000, when the yield per acre was relatively small, we may safely
infer, in the absence of trustworthy statistics, that it must have been
very much greater than at present.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>AGITATION IN IRELAND.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_286" id="TOPIC_286"></a>At the opening of 1837 there was a marked stagnation in home politics,
mainly due to an equipoise of parties and serious divisions in the ranks
of the ministerialists as well as of the opposition. Not only was there a
very strong conservative majority in the house of lords, with a sufficient
though dwindling liberal majority in the house of commons, but neither
majority was amenable to party discipline. The aggressive policy and
vexatious tactics of Lyndhurst were distasteful to his nominal leader, the
Duke of Wellington, and still more so to Peel, the only possible
conservative premier, who eschewed the very name of tory. There was
greater unity of counsels between Melbourne and Russell, but Russell, who
had learned moderation, was dependent on the support of his extreme left,
composed of violent radicals and Irish repealers. The king, though he did
not carry his repugnance to his ministers so far as he once threatened,
yet almost excluded them from social invitations, and made no secret of
his preference for the opposite party. During the winter of 1836-37
O'Connell and his satellites were busy in organising monster meetings to
demand the abolition of tithes and municipal reform. A national
association was formed on this basis, and a certain number of protestants
were induced to join it. The government dared not show vigour in checking
it lest they should estrange their Irish allies, and Mulgrave, the
lord-lieutenant, was openly accused of favouring sedition and discouraging
loyalty by his exercise of patronage and the royal prerogative of pardon.
At last, a very large and influential meeting was held in Dublin, at which
the discontent of loyalists and patriots was expressed with truly Irish
vehemence. Still, Ireland was less disturbed than in several previous
years. About the same time, Peel, having been elected lord rector of
Glasgow University, was entertained there at dinner by a company including
many old reformers, and made one of his greatest speeches. Its spirit was
that of his Tamworth manifesto, but he was far more outspoken in his
declaration of unswerving adhesion to the protestant cause and to the
independence of the upper house.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_287" id="TOPIC_287"></a>Such were the political conditions when parliament met on January 31. The
king's speech, delivered by commission, though singularly colourless,
indicated the importance of legislating on Irish tithes, Irish
corporations, and Irish poor relief. The debate on the address was
enlivened by a furious attack of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span> Roebuck on the whigs, but was otherwise
devoid of importance. On February 7, however, Russell introduced a new
Irish corporations bill, invoking the authority of Fox for the doctrine
that "Irish government should be regulated by Irish notions and Irish
prejudices," and avowing a faith in the efficacy of unlimited concession
which has not been justified by later experience. He further intimated the
resolution of the government to stand or fall by this measure. No serious
resistance was offered by the opposition to its first or second reading,
but Peel took occasion to protest against a transparent inconsistency
which seems to beset the advocacy of Irish claims. It is generally
assumed, and with too much justice, that Ireland is so backward and
helpless a country as to require exceptional treatment; in short, that it
must be governed by Irish ideas, with little regard to English principles
of sound policy or economy. Such was, in effect, Fox's contention, adopted
by Russell; and yet, like future supporters of "Ireland for the Irish," he
argued in the same breath that every liberal institution suitable to
Englishmen, with their long training in self-government and instinctive
reverence for law, must needs be extended to Irishmen, with their long
training in anarchy and instinctive propensity to lawlessness. He
prevailed, however, in the house of commons, where a hostile amendment was
decisively rejected, and the bill, having passed rapidly through
committee, was read a third time by a large though reduced majority.</p>

<p>Had it been possible to isolate the Irish municipal bill, and to compel
the house of lords to deal with it singly, the peers might possibly have
shrunk from another collision with the commons. But it had been coupled in
the king's speech with two other projects of Irish legislation, a new
tithe bill, and an Irish poor law. Both of these were, in fact,
introduced, the former by Russell in February, the latter by Morpeth early
in May. The course to be taken by the conservative party was the subject
of anxious consultation between Peel and Wellington, and that ultimately
adopted had the full sanction of both. They regarded the separate
presentation of the municipal bill as a "man&oelig;uvre," and, while they
overruled the wish of Lyndhurst to defeat it by an adverse vote on the
second reading, they resolved to meet it by a counter-man&oelig;uvre.
Accordingly Wellington induced the house of lords to postpone the
com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>mittee on the municipal bill until they should have the other two
bills before them, and Peel not only approved of his action but stated
reasons for regarding them as essentially connected with each other. June
9 was originally fixed as the date for going into committee, but this
stage was afterwards deferred until July 3, before which unforeseen events
arrested all further progress.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CHURCH RATES.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_288" id="TOPIC_288"></a>In the meantime, the prestige of the government had been weakened by the
failure of their scheme for abolishing Church rates. The dissenters, no
longer content with religious liberty, were beginning to demand religious
equality. In the forefront of their grievances was that of paying rates
for the repair of parish churches which they did not attend, except as
members of the annual "vestry," where they could object to a rate but
might be out-voted by a majority of their fellow-parishioners. Althorp had
proposed a scheme for the removal of this grievance in 1834, involving a
parliamentary grant of &pound;250,000. Setting aside this alternative, as well
as that of a special contribution, voluntary or otherwise, from members of
the Church, Spring Rice now proposed a solution of his own. It consisted
in vesting the property of bishops and chapters in a commission which, by
improved management, might raise the necessary sum for church repairs,
without impairing the incomes of these ecclesiastical dignitaries. Before
the government plan was discussed in the house of commons, Howley,
archbishop of Canterbury, entered a strong protest against it in the house
of lords on the ground that it would reduce the bishops and chapters from
the position of landowners to that of "mere annuitants". Melbourne
complained of his protest somewhat angrily as premature, and provoked a
vehement reply from Blomfield, bishop of London, who, though a member of
the ecclesiastical commission, denounced any such diversion of revenues as
"a sacrilegious act of spoliation". In the elaborate debates on the
resolutions moved by Spring Rice in the house of commons Peel took his
stand partly on financial objections and partly on the injustice of taking
away from the Church a fund belonging to it by immemorial usage, and in
the main willingly contributed. Amendment after amendment was proposed by
members of the opposition, and, though each was defeated, the government
resolutions were ultimately carried by so narrow a majority in May that no
further action was taken.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_289" id="TOPIC_289"></a>The conservative reaction, now in visible progress, was typi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>fied by the
open secession of Burdett from the ranks of the reformers. This sincere
but indiscreet radical, who had once enjoyed a popularity similar to that
of Wilkes as a political martyr, became estranged from his party when it
accepted O'Connell as an auxiliary, if not as an ally. Having failed in
procuring the exclusion of the great Irish demagogue from Brooks's club,
in 1835, he withdrew his own name. Soon afterwards he became irregular in
his parliamentary attendance, and more than lukewarm in his allegiance.
Early in 1837 he was, like Stanley and Graham, so much suspected of
gravitating towards conservatism, that some of his Westminster
constituents publicly called upon him to resign. He took up the challenge,
and was re-elected against a radical opponent by a substantial majority.
It was his last re-election for a borough which he had represented for
thirty years. In the Church-rate debate he rose from the opposition side
of the house, and lamenting his separation from his old associates, did
not spare them either reproaches or hostile criticism.</p>

<p>Another desertion from the whig camp took place during this session, but
in an opposite direction. Roebuck, originally one of the philosophical
radicals, had become more and more violent in his attacks on his own
leaders, whom he accused of having deceived the people. According to him,
they were "aristocratic in principle, democratic in pretence," and all the
resources of his incisive rhetoric were exhausted in exposing their
incapacity, in a motion for a committee to consider the state of the
nation. This motion, so advocated, met with no support, and gave Russell
the opportunity of once more vindicating the wisdom of moderation in
statesmanship. But there were many besides Roebuck who were eager to
complete the work of the reform act by further organic changes, and the
notice book of the house of commons in 1837 embodied several proposals of
this kind. One was Grote's annual motion for the ballot, on which an
interesting debate took place. Among the others were two motions of Sir
William Molesworth for a reform of the upper house and for the abolition
of a property qualification for the lower house, a motion of Tennyson, who
had taken the additional name of D'Eyncourt, for the repeal of the
septennial act, and another of Hume for household suffrage, overshadowing
that of Duncombe for repealing the rate-paying clauses of the reform act<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
itself. Nearly all of these contained the germs of future legislation, but
they formed no part of the whig programme, nor could any whig government
have carried them against so powerful an opposition, with an invincible
reserve in the house of lords, during the last session of William IV. Only
seventeen public acts were actually passed in this session.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE DEATH OF WILLIAM IV.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_290" id="TOPIC_290"></a>There were, indeed, other reasons for declining to provoke a grave contest
at this juncture. The king's health was known to be failing, his death
under the law then in force would involve a general election, and no one
could desire his successor, a girl of eighteen, to begin her reign in the
midst of a political crisis. In May his illness assumed an alarming
aspect, early in June the medical reports satisfied the country that his
case was hopeless, on June 19 he received the last sacrament, and on the
20th he died at Windsor Castle. Something more than justice was done to
his character by the leaders of both parties in parliament, but something
less than justice has been done to it by later historians. He was inferior
in strength of will to his father, in ability to his eldest brother, and
in the higher virtues of a constitutional sovereign to his niece, who
succeeded him. But he was not only a kindly and well-meaning man, a good
husband to Queen Adelaide and a good father to his natural children,
faithful to his old friends, and bountiful in his charities; he was also a
loyal servant of the state, with a genuine sense of public duty, a natural
love of justice, an independent judgment, and a noble indifference to
personal or selfish objects. His lot was cast in almost revolutionary
times, and he was called upon to reign at an age when few men are capable
of shaking off old prejudices, yet he deserved well of his people in
supporting the ministry of Grey through all the stages of the reform
movement, in spite of his own declared sympathies, but in deference to his
own conviction of paramount obligation under the laws of the land. He was
quite as liberal in opinions as Peel, whose hearty interest in the poorer
classes he fully shared, and far more liberal than the tory majority in
the house of lords. Great he certainly was not, and he never affected the
royal dignity which partially concealed the littleness of his predecessor.
But in honesty and simplicity he was no unworthy son of George III., and
the greater pliability of his nature contributed, at least, to make the
seven years of his reign more fruitful in reforms than all the sixty years
during which the old king occupied the throne of England.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII"></a>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>

<h3>FOREIGN RELATIONS UNDER WILLIAM IV.</h3>


<p><a name="TOPIC_291" id="TOPIC_291"></a>In 1830 the closing months of Wellington's administration were disturbed
by the French and Belgian revolutions. The former of these was occasioned
by the publication on July 25 of three ordinances, restricting the liberty
of the press, dissolving the chambers, and amending the law of elections.
The Parisian populace rose against this infringement of the constitution.
In the course of a three days' street-fight (the 27th to the 29th) the
troops were driven out of Paris. On the 30th a few members of the
chambers, who had continued in session, invited Louis Philippe, Duke of
Orl&eacute;ans, to assume the office of lieutenant-general of the kingdom, and he
was proclaimed on the following day. On August 7 the chamber of deputies
offered him the crown, which he accepted, and on the 9th he was proclaimed
"King of the French". On the 2nd Charles X. and the dauphin had renounced
their rights in favour of the young Duke of Bordeaux, and on the 16th they
sailed from Cherbourg to England. The change of dynasty was accompanied by
a transference to the <i>bourgeoisie</i> of such political influence as had
hitherto belonged to the clergy and <i>noblesse</i>. It remained to be seen
whether it would also be accompanied by a change of foreign policy.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>RECOGNITION OF LOUIS PHILIPPE.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_292" id="TOPIC_292"></a>The new French revolution occasioned no slight perturbation in the
European courts. To say nothing of the fear of the precedent being
followed in other lands, there was no longer any guarantee that France
would respect the arrangements effected by the treaties of Vienna and
Paris. Austria, Prussia, and Russia agreed not to recognise Louis
Philippe, and entered into a convention for mutual aid in the event of
French aggression. Aberdeen, the British foreign secretary, declared that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
the time had come for applying the treaty of Chaumont, which, as extended
at Paris, pledged Great Britain and the three eastern powers to act
together in case fresh revolution and usurpation in France should endanger
the repose of other states. Wellington, however, saw that the cause of the
elder Bourbon line was hopeless, and held now, as in 1815, that if France
was not to menace the peace of Europe, her political position must be one
with which she could be contented. He considered that the arguments which
justified the admission of France to the councils of the powers at
Aix-la-Chapelle in 1818 applied with no less cogency to the government of
Louis Philippe than to that of Louis XVIII. He therefore determined to
acknowledge the new French government at an early date after the
notification of its assumption of power. Nor were the other powers slow in
taking the same course. It is true that Metternich suggested a closer bond
between Austria, Prussia, and Russia, partly to restore amicable relations
between Austria and Russia, partly to oppose any possible designs of
France on Italy. Prussia, fearing war, resisted the proposal, and
preferred to draw France into a guarantee of the <i>status quo</i> by
recognising Louis Philippe. Russia was last of the great powers to
acknowledge the new <i>r&eacute;gime</i> in France, and she only did so on condition
that the powers should hold the French king responsible for the execution
of the international engagements of the fallen dynasty. Louis Philippe was
certainly not the man wilfully to embroil France in a war with her
neighbours, and, had he been independent of French public opinion, there
would have been no reason to fear French aggression.</p>

<p>The state which had most to fear from an aggressive France was the new
kingdom of the Netherlands. Trusting for protection to the great powers
rather than to its own forces, the Netherlands government had adopted a
system which left it almost entirely without troops except during the
military exercises of September and October. Wellington, who knew the
pacific character of the new French government, advised the garrisoning of
certain isolated points on the frontier, but thought no further
preparation necessary. A few weeks were however to prove that the new
French revolution had aroused a more implacable enemy, against whom the
house of Orange would have needed all the troops it could summon to its
aid.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span> The union of Holland and Belgium had been resolved on by the powers
at Paris in 1814, mainly for military reasons. Austria had been unwilling
to resume the heavy burden of guarding the Belgian Netherlands and
southern Germany against French aggression, and the powers had
consequently resolved on strengthening those smaller states on whom the
duty of resistance would fall. In these days, accustomed as we are to the
distinction between the Teutonic and Latin races, it might seem reasonable
that two countries in which the prevailing languages are low German should
be subject to the same government. But it was not yet customary to turn
the principles of comparative philology into arguments for the
rearrangement of political boundaries. The French language and culture had
moreover made considerable progress among the upper and middle classes of
Belgium, while religious differences alienated the clergy from the house
of Orange. In the states-general of the Netherlands the Dutch had half the
votes, and, as the Orange party was strong in Antwerp and Ghent, commanded
a majority. The fiscal system adopted by the government favoured the Dutch
rather than the Belgian population. Dutchmen were generally preferred for
state offices, and an attempt to control the education of the clergy was
deeply resented as an attack on the Roman catholic religion. Belgium in
consequence presented the curious spectacle of the liberal and clerical
parties working on the same side, united against the Dutch government.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>BELGIAN REVOLUTION.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_293" id="TOPIC_293"></a>The example afforded by France turned a discontent which might have led to
local riots into a national conflagration. On August 25 there was a rising
of the populace at Brussels, which the troops proved unable to quell. On
the 27th it was suppressed by a body of burgher guards, a volunteer force
drawn from the <i>bourgeoisie</i> of the town. The <i>bourgeoisie</i> finding
themselves in possession of the Belgian capital, at first presented a
series of minor demands to the king, but on September 3 they went the
length of demanding a separate administration for Belgium. The king
undertook to lay this proposal before the states, which assembled on the
13th. But before the states could come to any conclusion the question had
assumed a new aspect. All the leading towns of Belgium had followed the
example of Brussels by forming burgher guards and had thus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span> joined in the
revolution; and on the 20th a fresh rising of the populace of Brussels had
overthrown the burgher guard and instituted a provisional government. This
was followed by an attempt on the part of Prince Frederick of Orange, a
younger son of the King of the Netherlands, to occupy Brussels with a
military force. After five days' fighting he was compelled to retire, and
when on the 30th the states-general gave their consent to the proposal for
a separate administration, their decision fell upon deaf ears. All the
Belgian provinces were in revolt.</p>

<p>It was now clear to everybody that the national party in Belgium would not
consent even to a personal union with Holland. As the union of the two
countries formed a part of the treaty of Vienna, every European power had
a legal right to employ force to prevent its disruption, and Russia and
Prussia both desired active intervention. In France, on the other hand,
there was a loud popular demand for the reannexation of Belgium to France,
of which it had formed a part from 1794 to 1814. Louis Philippe saw that
he could not resist this demand if the Belgian insurgents were coerced on
the side of Prussia, and therefore announced that Prussian aggression
would be met by a French expedition to Belgium to keep the balance even,
until the question should be settled by a congress of the powers. On
September 25 Talleyrand had arrived in England. He quickly obtained the
adhesion of Wellington to the principle of non-intervention. The duke had
been among the first to grasp the fact that reconciliation of Dutch and
Belgians was impossible, and that the intervention of the powers would
necessitate a European war, to avoid which the union of the two countries
had originally been designed. He agreed therefore to a separation of the
countries on condition that France should bind herself to observe the
arrangements of the congress of Vienna in 1815 and should take no separate
action in Belgium.</p>

<p>On Talleyrand's suggestion it was decided to refer the question to the
conference already sitting in London for the purpose of settling the Greek
question, which would of course have to be reinforced by representatives
of Austria and Prussia for the present purpose. Mol&eacute;, the French foreign
minister, would have preferred Paris as the seat of the congress, but the
King of the Netherlands absolutely refused to entrust his cause to a
conference meeting in a city where opinion ran so strongly against him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
On October 5 he made a formal appeal to the powers for the aid guaranteed
him by treaty, but the demand came too late to induce Wellington to swerve
from the policy of non-intervention, and on November 4 the conference of
London began its labours by proposing an armistice in Belgium, which was
accepted by both parties. This left Maastricht and the citadel of Antwerp
in the hands of Dutch garrisons, and Luxemburg in the hands of a garrison
supplied by the German confederation. Every other place in Belgium was in
the hands of the insurgents. But the further solution of the question was
reserved for other hands. On the 3rd Louis Philippe was compelled to
accept a revolutionary ministry, and on the 22nd Wellington and Aberdeen
had to make way for a whig ministry with Grey as premier, and Palmerston
as foreign secretary.</p>

<p>The new foreign secretary had served a long political apprenticeship as
secretary at war in the successive administrations of Perceval, Liverpool,
Canning, Goderich, and Wellington, and under the three last-mentioned
premiers he had enjoyed a seat in the cabinet. It will be remembered that
he had been a warm champion of Greece, and had resigned office along with
Huskisson, Dudley, and Grant. He now returned in company with Grant as a
member of a whig cabinet. Although this change of party involved the
adoption of a domestic policy far removed from Canning's, Palmerston's
foreign policy remained rather Canningite than whig. The interest and the
honour of England ranked with Palmerston as with Canning before all
questions which concerned the maintenance of European peace. But instead
of Canning's versatile diplomacy he displayed too often a reckless
disregard of the susceptibilities of foreign governments, and, if, like
Canning, he lent the moral support of Great Britain to the liberal party
in every continental country, it was not, as it had professedly been with
Canning, because their success would promote the interests of Great
Britain, but because he had a genuine sympathy with their cause. It is
impossible to deny that in his earlier years at least Palmerston's policy
met with a success such as Castlereagh and Wellington had not attempted to
gain; real or imaginary dangers at home left the foreign governments too
weak to oppose the will of the one strong man of the moment. Yet it is
doubtful whether any resultant benefits were not more than counterbalanced
by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span> distrust and ill-will with which the greater nations of Europe
have learned to regard the British government and people.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>PROPOSED DIVISION OF THE NETHERLANDS.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_294" id="TOPIC_294"></a>During the first few weeks of the new administration, the Belgian question
advanced far towards a settlement. On November 10 a Belgian national
congress assembled at Brussels; on the 18th it voted the independence of
Belgium; on the 22nd it resolved that the new state should be a
constitutional monarchy, and on the 24th it proclaimed the total exclusion
of the house of Nassau. Finally the outbreak of a Polish insurrection at
Warsaw made it clear that Prussia and Russia would be too busily occupied
in the east to be able to interfere effectively in the Belgian question.
On December 20 a protocol was signed at London by the representatives of
the five powers, providing for the separation of Belgium from Holland.
When however the protocol was sent to the tsar for ratification, he would
only ratify it subject to the condition that its execution should depend
on the consent of the King of the Netherlands. Meanwhile the London
conference was engaged in settling the boundary of the new kingdom. For
the most part it went on the principle of leaving to Holland the districts
that had belonged to the United Provinces before the wars of the French
revolution. The remainder of the kingdom of the Netherlands, consisting
chiefly of the former Austrian Netherlands, but including also territories
which had belonged to France, Prussia, the Palatinate, the bishopric of
Li&egrave;ge, and some minor ecclesiastical states, was assigned to Belgium. An
exception was, however, made in the case of the grand duchy of Luxemburg.
Luxemburg was reputed to be, next to Gibraltar, the strongest fortress in
Europe. It was regarded as the key to the lower Rhine; it formed a part of
the German confederation, and was garrisoned by German troops. Although
Holland had no historical claim to its possession, the treaty of Vienna
granted it to the Dutch branch of the house of Nassau, as compensation for
its former possessions, merged in the duchy of Nassau; and it was now felt
that a place so important to the safety of Germany could not safely be
handed over to a state which seemed likely to fall under French influence.
The powers therefore determined that this duchy should continue to belong
to the king of the Netherlands.</p>

<p>There was also some difficulty over the apportionment of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span> the debt.
Belgium was the more populous and the richer of the two countries, but the
greater part of the debt had been contracted by Holland before the union.
Belgium was, however, already responsible for its share of the whole debt,
and the powers can hardly be accused of injustice when they determined to
divide the debt in the proportion in which the debt-charges had been borne
in the three previous years, assigning sixteen thirty-firsts to Belgium,
and fifteen thirty-firsts to Holland. Belgium was moreover to possess the
right of trading with the Dutch colonies and to contribute towards their
defence. These provisions were embodied in two protocols which were issued
at London on January 20 and 27, 1831. As compared with the <i>status quo</i>
the Dutch were slightly the gainers. The protocol permitted them to keep
Maastricht and Luxemburg, but required them to abandon the citadel of
Antwerp; while the Belgians were required to surrender those less
important places which they had occupied in Dutch Limburg and in the grand
duchy of Luxemburg. Talleyrand considered the present a favourable
opportunity for claiming for France the cession of Mariembourg and
Philippeville which she had been compelled to surrender to the kingdom of
the Netherlands in 1815. Palmerston, however, absolutely refused to hear
of any extension of French territory, for fear of imperilling the security
of Europe. The two protocols were accepted by Holland on February 13 but
rejected by Belgium. Though Talleyrand had signed the protocol of January
20, it was repudiated by S&eacute;bastiani, the French foreign minister, on the
ground that the object of the conference was to effect a mediation, not to
dictate a settlement.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>BELGIUM CHOOSES A KING.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_295" id="TOPIC_295"></a>Meanwhile the national congress at Brussels had attempted to elect a king.
At first the most favoured candidate was Auguste Beauharnais, Duke of
Leuchtenberg, the grandson of Napoleon's first consort. Louis Philippe
naturally objected to the establishment on his frontier of a prince so
closely connected with the house of Bonaparte. The pliant Belgians
accordingly transferred their preference to the Duke of Nemours, the
second son of Louis Philippe. It was in vain that S&eacute;bastiani declared that
France could not allow such a selection, as it would be interpreted by the
powers as evidence of a French design to reincorporate Belgium in France.
On February<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span> 3, 1831, the Duke of Nemours was actually elected king by the
Belgian national congress. But the conference of London had, two days
earlier, adopted a resolution, excluding from the Belgian throne all
members of the reigning dynasties of the five powers. Still there was a
strong party in France, including Laffitte, the revolutionary premier, who
advocated the claims of Nemours. Louis Philippe, however, stood firm on
the side of European peace, and on the 17th definitively declined the
crown offered to his son. The French now recommended the Prince of Naples,
but the Belgians declined to accept him, and on the 25th the national
congress appointed a regent to hold office till a king should be elected.
On March 13 the accession to office of an anti-revolutionary ministry in
France rendered the complete co-operation of the powers easier.</p>

<p>On April 17 France declared her adhesion to the protocol of January 20,
and by a new protocol the other four powers consented to the demolition of
some of the Belgian fortresses on the French frontier. Another protocol of
the same date ordered the Belgians to evacuate the grand duchy of
Luxemburg. On May 10 a further protocol even threatened Belgium with the
rupture of diplomatic relations in case she did not by June I accept the
protocol of January 20. But the powers soon adopted a more conciliatory
attitude. France and Great Britain desired that Prince Leopold of
Saxe-Coburg, who in the previous year had resigned the crown of Greece,
should now be offered that of Belgium. Prince Leopold would not accept the
crown so long as Belgium continued to defy the powers, and on the other
hand there was no chance of securing his election by the Belgian congress
unless he undertook to maintain the Belgian claim to the possession of
Luxemburg. Lord Ponsonby, the British minister at Brussels, succeeded in
inducing the London conference to sign a new protocol, undertaking to
negotiate with Holland for the cession of Luxemburg to Belgium, in return
for an indemnity elsewhere, provided that Belgium should first accept the
protocol of January 20. The Belgian congress gathered that the acceptance
of Prince Leopold was regarded by the powers as more important than the
maintenance of the terms of that protocol, and they accordingly elected
him as their king on June 4 without accepting the protocol. In answer to
Dutch complaints Ponsonby and General Belliard, the French<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span> minister, were
recalled from Brussels as the protocol of May 10 required. Leopold refused
to accept the crown until the conference should have offered better terms,
and on the 26th the conference signed another protocol, which differed
from that of January 20 in that it left the Luxemburg question open for
future negotiation, and rendered Holland liable for the whole of the debt
that it had incurred before the union of the two countries. On the same
day Leopold accepted the Belgian crown. The Belgian congress accepted this
last protocol on July 7, and on the 21st Leopold was proclaimed king, and
immediately recognised by Great Britain and France. The other great powers
were not long in following their example.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_296" id="TOPIC_296"></a>It was now Holland's turn to feel aggrieved. She refused to recognise the
changes proposed by the powers in the terms which she had already
accepted. On May 21 she had declared that if the protocol of January 20
were not accepted by June 1 she would consider herself free to act on her
own account, and on July 12 that the acceptance in Belgium of a king who
had not agreed to that protocol would be an act of hostility. Feeling
herself betrayed by the conference she gave notice on August 1 that the
armistice which had existed since the previous November would terminate on
the 4th. It was soon seen how much Holland had lost in the preceding year
by being found in a state of military unpreparedness. When hostilities
began the Dutch carried everything before them. On the 8th the Belgians
were routed at Hasselt, and on the 13th Leopold in person was compelled to
surrender Louvain. But Holland was now arrested in the full tide of her
success. The opportunity that French patriots had long desired had
presented itself, and Louis Philippe would only have endangered his own
throne if he had failed to come to the assistance of Belgium against
Holland. On the 4th he received Leopold's appeal for assistance; on the
12th the first French division reached Brussels, and on the following day
the Prince of Orange, who led the main Dutch army, received orders from
the Hague to retire within the Dutch frontier.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>COERCION OF HOLLAND.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_297" id="TOPIC_297"></a>The conference had in fact found it necessary to join in measures of
coercion. On the first news of the outbreak of hostilities it severely
reproached Holland for the breach of the armistice, and ordered the Dutch
forces to retire. By a pro<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>tocol of the 6th it accepted and justified the
French expedition, which, it knew, could not safely be recalled, and tried
to minimise the danger by forbidding the French to cross the Dutch
frontier and requiring them to return to France as soon as the Dutch
should return to Holland. At the same time a semblance of joint action was
created by the despatch of a British fleet to the Downs. If the Dutch
invasion of Belgium created excitement in France, the French expedition
had a similar effect in England, and Palmerston found it necessary to
insist sternly on the immediate evacuation of Belgium upon the withdrawal
of the Dutch troops. The French government naturally desired to point to
some tangible triumph of French arms, and requested that the troops should
be allowed to remain till the frontier fortresses should have been
demolished in accordance with the protocol of April 17. In a somewhat
insulting message Palmerston threatened a general war sooner than allow
the French troops to remain. The most that France could obtain was that
12,000 men might remain a fortnight longer than the rest and that a number
of French officers might enlist in the Belgian service.</p>

<p>The conference now returned to the task of effecting a settlement in
accordance with the terms of the protocol of June 26. On October 15 it
provided for the partition of the grand duchy of Luxemburg between Holland
and Belgium and for the indemnification of Holland with a larger portion
of Limburg than had belonged to her in 1790. At the same time provision
was made for the freedom of the Scheldt, and the debt was reassessed,
8,400,000 florins of <i>rentes</i><a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> being assigned to Belgium and
19,300,000 to Holland. Along with this protocol a letter was sent to the
Belgian plenipotentiary, promising that if Belgium accepted it, the powers
would undertake to obtain the consent of Holland. The protocol was
converted into a treaty by the adhesion of Belgium on November 15.
Meanwhile the King of the Netherlands had appealed to the tsar against the
action of the western powers and of the Russian plenipotentiaries at
London, and the tsar had in consequence refused to ratify the treaty till
the King of the Netherlands should have given his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span> consent. That consent
was slow in coming. It was only on June 30, 1832, that Holland agreed to
the exchange of territories and the reduction of Belgium's share of the
debt, and even then questions remained as to the dues on the Scheldt and
the transit of goods through Dutch Limburg. The Belgians refused to
negotiate further until the citadel of Antwerp should be surrendered; the
Dutch on the other hand refused to surrender it till a definite treaty
should be signed and ratified. On October 1 France, with the approval of
the British government, proposed to suspend the payment of the Belgian
share of the interest on the debt until the citadel of Antwerp should be
surrendered, and to deduct from the share of the principal payable by
Belgium, 500,000 florins of <i>rentes</i> for each week that should elapse
before the surrender. The three eastern powers refused to agree to any
coercion of Holland, and, in consequence, Great Britain and France
determined to act alone.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_298" id="TOPIC_298"></a>On the 22nd they signed a convention providing for the coercion of Holland
by an embargo and by the despatch of a squadron to the Dutch coast. If any
Dutch troops should be still in Belgium on November 15, a French force was
empowered, subject to the consent of the Belgian government, to advance
into Belgium and expel the Dutch troops from the country. The French were,
however, to retire as soon as the Dutch evacuation was complete. The first
result of this convention was the suspension of the conference. On the
29th the two powers made their demand. As the Dutch refused compliance, a
joint French and British fleet sailed on November 4 to blockade the
Scheldt, and the embargo was proclaimed on the 6th. On the 15th a French
army of 56,000 men, commanded by G&eacute;rard, entered Belgium. On December 4 it
opened fire on the citadel of Antwerp, which surrendered after a nineteen
days' bombardment on the 23rd. The French army returned to its own country
before the end of the year, leaving the Dutch in possession of two small
forts on the Belgian side of the frontier, which were more than
compensated by the positions held by the Belgians in Dutch Limburg. Even
the fall of the citadel of Antwerp did not induce Holland to accept the
settlement proposed by the powers, and Great Britain and France now
attempted to effect a working agreement pending negotiations on the
details of the treaty. <a name="TOPIC_299" id="TOPIC_299"></a>It was in vain that Holland asked that Belgium
should evacuate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span> the Dutch provinces of Limburg and Luxemburg and pay her
share of the interest on the Dutch debt. Palmerston and Talleyrand refused
to include these provisions in a preliminary convention. Finally on March
21, 1833, a convention was signed between Great Britain, France, and
Holland, which terminated the embargo and provided for the free navigation
of the Scheldt and Maas. A similar convention was signed between Holland
and Belgium on November 18. Six years, however, were to elapse before the
Dutch government would consent to the conditions drawn up by the powers in
1831. Meanwhile the Belgians were free from their share of debt, held the
greater part of Limburg and Luxemburg, and enjoyed the free navigation of
the Maas and the Scheldt, over and above the terms granted them in 1831.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>POLISH REBELLION.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_300" id="TOPIC_300"></a>It is inconceivable that the Belgian question should have been left so
entirely in the hands of the two western powers, and that the settlement
should have taken the form of a foreign coercion of a legitimate king for
his unreadiness to make concessions to his revolted subjects, had not the
attention of the three absolutist powers of eastern and central Europe
been directed to another quarter. Just as the revolution of 1820 had
spread through southern Europe in spite of Castlereagh's attempt to
maintain that it was not of a contagious order, so that of 1830 awakened
similar outbursts not only at Brussels but in various German states, in
Switzerland, in Poland, and in Italy. The Polish insurrection was, like
the Belgian, a national revolt, and the consequent military operations
were of the nature of a war between Poland and Russia. The revolt broke
out at Warsaw on November 29, 1830, and on January 25, 1831, the Polish
diet proclaimed the independence of Poland. On February 5 a Russian army
crossed the Polish frontier. In France there was a loud popular demand for
intervention. But even the Laffitte ministry would not move without the
co-operation of Great Britain, though the French ambassador at
Constantinople tried to stir up the Porte to hostilities. The ministry of
Casimir-Perier, which came into office in March, proposed a joint
mediation of France and Great Britain, but to this Palmerston would not
assent. He remonstrated with Russia on her violations of the Polish
constitution, which Great Britain, along with the other powers, had
guaranteed at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span> congress of Vienna, but he could not support the Polish
claim to independence, since Great Britain had made herself a party to the
union of the two countries. As it happened, the remonstrance was simply a
cause of annoyance, which subsequent events were destined to intensify. <a name="TOPIC_301" id="TOPIC_301"></a>It
was only on September 8, 1831, that the Russians under Paskievitch
captured Warsaw, an event which was followed on February 26, 1832, by the
abolition of the Polish constitution. Palmerston protested again but with
no more success than in the previous year.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>DOM MIGUEL AND DON CARLOS.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_302" id="TOPIC_302"></a>In the Portuguese, as in the Belgian question, Palmerston drifted from the
position of a neutral into that of a partisan. Ever since the year 1828,
British subjects accused of political offences had been brutally
ill-treated in Portugal, and as time went on the excesses increased. By
despatching six British warships to the Tagus Palmerston succeeded in
obtaining a pecuniary indemnity and a public apology on May 2, 1831.
Similar insults to France were not so readily redressed. A threat of force
on the part of the French government was followed by an appeal from Dom
Miguel for British assistance. This Palmerston refused to grant, and in
July a French squadron under Admiral Roussin forced the passage of the
Tagus, and carried off the best ships of the Portuguese navy. Meanwhile
much irritation had been caused in Brazil by Peter's advocacy of his
daughter's claim to Portugal, which was considered inconsistent with his
professed adherence to the separation of the two countries. On April 6,
Peter abdicated the crown of Brazil in favour of his infant son, Peter
II., and on the following day sailed for Europe in order to assert his
daughter's right to the Portuguese throne. He arrived in Europe towards
the end of May, and visited both England and France.</p>

<p>Though neither government assisted him directly, he was permitted to raise
troops and even to secure the services of naval officers, and in December
a force of 300 men sailed from Liverpool to Belleisle, which he had
appointed as the rendezvous. Palmerston had thus, unlike Wellington,
adopted the same attitude towards the Portuguese liberals that Ferdinand
VII. had adopted towards the absolutists. Peter's expedition gathered
further strength at the Azores and sailed for Portugal on June 27, 1832.
On July 8, the fleet, commanded by Admiral Sartorius, a British officer,
appeared off Oporto, which submitted on the following day. The town was,
however,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span> blockaded by Miguel's forces and Peter's cause made no headway
until in June, 1833, the command of the fleet was transferred to Captain
(afterwards Admiral Sir Charles) Napier. On the night of June 24, he
landed at Villa Real a force of 2,500 men who conquered the province of
Algarve in a week, and on July 5 he annihilated Miguel's navy in an
engagement off Cape St. Vincent. After a further battle near Lisbon,
Peter's forces entered the capital on the 24th, and subsequently repulsed
a Miguelite attack upon the city. Miguel still held out in northern
Portugal, when another train of events caused the western powers to
substitute direct for indirect interference.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_303" id="TOPIC_303"></a>Ferdinand VII. of Spain had fallen so entirely under the influence of his
fourth and last queen, Maria Christina of Naples, as to repeal by a
pragmatic sanction the Salic law which the treaty of Utrecht had
established as the rule of succession in Spain. The result of this edict
was to leave the succession to his infant daughter Isabella instead of his
brother Don Carlos, the leader of the Spanish absolutists. When Ferdinand
died on September 29, 1833, Don Carlos was absent from the kingdom,
supporting the cause of his fellow-pretender Dom Miguel. Isabella received
the hearty support of the constitutional party and was almost universally
acknowledged as queen. It was only in Biscay, where the centralising
tendency of the Spanish constitution, published on April 10, 1834, seemed
to entrench upon local liberty, that Don Carlos met with much active
support. His cause, like that of Miguel in Portugal, was the more popular,
but his adherents were as yet almost entirely devoid of organisation.
<a name="TOPIC_304" id="TOPIC_304"></a>Peter's partisans had already made substantial progress towards a complete
victory, and Santha Martha, the Miguelite commander-in-chief, had
surrendered in the beginning of April, when on April 22 a triple alliance,
already signed between Great Britain, Maria Christina, Queen-regent of
Spain, and Peter, as regent of Portugal, was converted into a quadruple
alliance by the adhesion of France. This treaty provided for the
co-operation of Spain and Portugal to expel Dom Miguel and Don Carlos from
the Portuguese dominions. Great Britain was to assist by the employment of
a naval force, and France was to render assistance, if required, in such
manner as should be settled afterwards by common consent of the four
contracting powers. The Spanish general, Rodil, immediately crossed the
frontier. He met with no resistance, and on May<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span> 26 Miguel signed a
convention at Evora, by which he accepted a pension, renounced his rights
to the Portuguese throne, and agreed to quit the country.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE CARLIST WAR.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_305" id="TOPIC_305"></a>Don Carlos, however, refused to renounce his rights to the Spanish throne,
and all that the British navy could do was to convey the two pretenders,
Carlos to England and Miguel to Genoa. Although Miguel, on June 20,
repudiated his abdication, the Portuguese question was really at an end.
The Spanish question was, however, merely entering on its critical stage.
Don Carlos secretly left London on July 1, and nine days later appeared at
the Carlist headquarters in Spain. Here he had the assistance of the
ablest general of this war, Zumalacarregui. Melbourne's succession to the
premiership in July left Palmerston at the foreign office, and was
followed by no change in foreign policy. On August 18 an additional
article to the quadruple alliance provided that France was to prevent
reinforcements or warlike stores from reaching Don Carlos from the French
side of the frontier, while Great Britain was to supply arms and stores to
the Spanish royalists and, if necessary, intervene with a naval force. The
short interlude of conservative government, with Peel as premier and
Wellington as foreign secretary, was not marked by any change of policy
nor yet by any new aggressions. Wellington's only interference with the
course of hostilities was the mission of Lord Eliot to Navarre, which
induced the combatants to abandon for the time being those cruelties to
prisoners which had been the disgrace of the Spanish civil wars.</p>

<p>Shortly after the return of Melbourne and Palmerston to power,
Zumalacarregui won a victory in the valley of Amascoas on April 21 and 22,
1835, which opened to him the road to Madrid. The Madrid government now
appealed to France to send 12,000 men to occupy the Basque provinces. By
the terms of the quadruple alliance the assent of Great Britain and
Portugal was necessary in order to determine the manner in which France
was to render assistance. Thiers, on behalf of Louis Philippe, suggested a
separate French expedition on the lines of that of 1823. Palmerston, like
Canning before him, refused to sanction such an expedition, though he was
prepared to allow France to make the expedition on her own responsibility.
He suggested in return that Great Britain should intervene. But Louis
Philippe was equally opposed to the separate action<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span> of his own country
and of Great Britain, and the result was that neither government sent any
troops. The Spanish government was, however, permitted to enlist
volunteers, and actually received the assistance of an English legion, a
French legion, and 6,000 Portuguese. The immediate danger was averted by
the obstinacy of Don Carlos, who refused to permit Zumalacarregui to march
on Madrid till the conquest of Biscay was complete. The Carlist general
turned aside in consequence to the siege of Bilbao, in which a few weeks
later he met his death.</p>

<p>In February, 1836, some changes in the French ministry increased the power
of Thiers, who had so recently advocated the policy of intervention.
Palmerston now proposed a French expedition to the Basque provinces, while
the British were to occupy St. Sebastian and Pasages. Thiers did not,
however, feel strong enough to accept this offer, and Palmerston
determined to act alone. A British squadron under Lord John Hay was
despatched to the Spanish coast with instructions to assist the royalist
forces. This squadron is probably entitled to the principal share in the
credit for the successful resistance of Bilbao to the Carlist armies. In
May, however, a conservative government entered upon office in Spain, and
France became more ready to grant assistance. Isturiz, the new Spanish
premier, persuaded Louis Philippe to send some troops to Spain; but by
leaning on foreign support Isturiz had overreached himself. Spanish
indignation found vent in a revolutionary movement, accompanied by
bloodshed; one town after another declared for the constitution of 1812,
which the queen-regent was forced to sign on August 13, and on the
following day a progressist ministry was installed in office. Austria,
Prussia, and Russia withdrew their ambassadors from Madrid after the riots
of the 13th, and Louis Philippe recalled the forces he had sent to the
assistance of the Spanish government. Had Don Carlos listened to the
advice of the eastern powers and given such assurances as might have won
over the more moderate of Isabella's supporters, he would probably have
proved successful. As it was the war dragged on, but De Lacy Evans, who
was in command of the British legion, left Spain on June 10, 1837, and
most of his men followed soon after. The question of intervention had,
however, put an end to that cordial co-operation of Great Britain and
France which had existed ever since the July<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span> revolution, and left Great
Britain as isolated in the counsels of Europe as she had been when Canning
and Wellington dissociated themselves from the other powers at Verona.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_306" id="TOPIC_306"></a>The settlement of the Greek question proceeded very slowly. While the
powers were seeking a possible king, Capodistrias exercised an autocratic
sway as president. However, in the spring of 1831, the Mainots of southern
Laconia and the Hydriots revolted against him, and got possession of the
Greek fleet. Capodistrias appealed to Russia for assistance, and a Russian
squadron was sent to blockade the Greek fleet at Poros. But Miaoulis, the
Greek admiral, sank his ships in order to save them from the Russians. The
situation was simplified by the assassination of Capodistrias on October
9, which left two rival national assemblies struggling for the mastery.
The French troops failed to maintain order, and the way was clear for a
king who would have the prestige of an international treaty and an
independent revenue to support his position. <a name="TOPIC_307" id="TOPIC_307"></a>This was the situation when
on February 13, 1832, a protocol was signed at London, offering the Greek
crown to Otto, the second son of King Lewis of Bavaria, a boy of
seventeen. The boundary was to be fixed where Palmerston, while still a
member of the Wellington administration, had wished to fix it, along a
line running from the Gulf of Arta to that of Volo. King Lewis would not,
however, agree to accept the crown for his son unless he should be granted
the title of king, instead of prince, and should be guaranteed a loan to
enable him to meet the expenses of his position. On May 7, 1832, the
London protocol was embodied in a treaty of London; the crown was
definitely conferred on Otto, who was given the title of king, guaranteed
a loan, not exceeding &pound;2,400,000, and allowed to take out 3,500 Bavarian
troops with him. The Turkish consent to the proposed boundary was given on
July 21; Greece accepted the treaty in August, and the new king left for
his kingdom in December.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>VICTORIES OF IBRAHIM.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_308" id="TOPIC_308"></a>Greece now disappears from the eastern question. But Ibrahim Pasha, whose
successes in Greece had induced Canning to interfere, had already
disclosed a new phase of that question by successes gained in another
quarter. Mehemet Ali had quickly repaired the losses which his fleet and
army had sus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>tained in the Peloponnese. Meanwhile he demanded from Sultan
Mahmud that Ibrahim should be compensated with a part of Syria for the
loss of the Morea, which had been promised him as a reward for his
services in Greece. The sultan refused to grant this insolent demand, and
Mehemet Ali determined to conquer the province for himself. Abdallah,
Pasha of Acre, had taken under his protection some fugitive peasants, and
Mehemet Ali, in spite of the sultan's prohibition, sent Ibrahim with an
army of 30,000 men against him. He laid siege to Acre on December 9, 1831,
and took it on May 27, 1832. On July 8 he routed a Turkish army at Homs;
on the 29th he routed a larger army at the pass of Beilan, and on the 31st
he entered Antioch. In November he was at Konieh. The Tsar Nicholas had,
with Palmerston's approval, already sent Lieutenant-General Muraviov on a
mission to Constantinople, offering military and naval support; but the
sultan preferred to seek British assistance first.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the message came at a time when the British fleet was
preparing to blockade the coasts of the Netherlands, and could not be
spared for service In the Mediterranean. An appeal to France was equally
unsuccessful. She had by this time formed the siege of the citadel of
Antwerp, and was moreover naturally averse from a struggle with Ibrahim,
whose army had been organised and trained by French officers. The sultan
therefore decided to avail himself of the offers made by Russia. Indeed he
had no choice, for the news now came that on December 21 Ibrahim had
completely defeated the Turkish general, Reshid, at Konieh and that there
was no army between him and Constantinople. Muraviov was sent on a vain
mission to Alexandria with authority to cede Acre to Mehemet Ali if he
would surrender his fleet to the sultan. Ibrahim advanced to Kiutayeh and
his advance-guard came as far as Broussa. The sultan on February 2, 1833,
requested the assistance of the Russian navy, and on the 20th a Russian
squadron appeared at Constantinople.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_309" id="TOPIC_309"></a>The powers that had refused to move to save Turkey from Ibrahim were quick
enough to interfere when the danger was from Russia and not from an
oriental. Ibrahim might have been expected to make a stronger ruler than
the sultan, whose fall seemed imminent. A Russian protectorate was a
different matter. Roussin, the French ambassador at Constantinople,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>
protested against the Russian alliance and threatened to leave
Constantinople. A French envoy was, at his suggestion, permitted to offer
Mehemet the governorship of the Syrian pashaliks of Tripoli and Acre. On
March 8 Mehemet rejected these terms, and declared that if his own terms
were not accepted within six weeks his troops would march upon
Constantinople. The sultan then turned to Russia again and asked for
troops. Fifteen thousand Russians were in consequence landed on the shores
of the Bosphorus, and in the beginning of April an army of 24,000, which
had remained in Moldavia ever since the war of 1828-29, prepared to march
southwards. Constantinople at least was thus rendered safe from Ibrahim,
and there was therefore more hope that Mehemet would come to terms. The
British, French, and Austrian ambassadors spared no effort to induce the
Porte to offer terms that might be accepted, and their representations
were probably rendered the more persuasive by the appearance of British
and French fleets in the &AElig;gean. Roussin especially urged that it was
better to surrender Syria than to reconquer it by Russian troops. At last
the sultan yielded, and on April 10 a peace was signed at Kiutayeh, though
not ratified by the sultan till May 15. This treaty granted to Mehemet Ali
Syria and Cilicia, but restored the bulk of Asia Minor to the Porte.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CONFERENCE OF M&Uuml;NCHENGR&Auml;TZ.</i></div>

<p>Turkey had been saved by the western powers, but only because they dreaded
the possibility of her being saved by Russia. A few weeks later their
worst fears seemed on the point of realisation. The Russian troops on the
Bosphorus were a sure guarantee of the predominance of Russian influence
at Constantinople, and this was illustrated in a marked degree by the
treaty of Unkiar Skelessi, signed on July 8, which provided for a
defensive alliance for eight years between Russia and the Porte. Russia
was, when required, to provide the sultan with both military and naval
forces, to be provisioned by him, but otherwise maintained by Russia. A
secret article, soon made known, provided that Russia would not ask for
material aid if at war, but that in that event the Porte would close the
Dardanelles to the warships of other nations. Great Britain had already
obtained the rights of the most favoured nation, so far as the passage of
the Dardanelles was concerned, and therefore maintained that the treaty
did not affect her right to pass<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span> those straits; and France joined her in
presenting identical notes declaring their intention of ignoring the
treaty in event of war. British public opinion, already wounded by the
conquest of Poland, was even more vehemently affected than British policy.
The treaty was regarded as the establishment in Turkey of a Russian
protectorate, which it was necessary for Great Britain to destroy, and the
antagonism thus produced has lasted to our own day. Matters were not
improved when the tsar asked for the cession of the Danubian
principalities, which were still occupied by Russia, in return for a
remission of the war indemnity owing since 1829. Austria, France, and
Great Britain protested against this proposal, and in consequence nothing
came of it.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_310" id="TOPIC_310"></a>Austria then assumed the <i>r&ocirc;le</i> of mediator. A friendly request for
explanation elicited a declaration from Russia, disclaiming all intention
of self-aggrandisement, and promising to accept the mediation of Austria
in any case where the treaty could be invoked. Austria in consequence
endeavoured to persuade the western powers that there was no immediate
danger, and that she would use her mediation to remove any danger that
might arise. Meanwhile she endeavoured to allay distrust of Russia by
inducing that power to evacuate the Danubian principalities. But before
this result could be accomplished the negotiations between Austria and
Russia had taken a turn which gave Austria, in English eyes, the
appearance of an accomplice rather than of a mediator. The revolutionary
movements of 1830 and following years had produced grave apprehensions in
the minds of the rulers of the three eastern powers, Austria, Prussia, and
Russia; and the coercion of Holland and Portugal caused them to feel a
deep distrust of the policy of Great Britain and France, and to grasp the
necessity of united action against the revolutionary forces at work in
Europe. For this purpose it was considered necessary to revive
Metternich's policy of 1820 as defined at Troppau. The three powers had
for some time been drawing together, and in September, 1833, the Emperors
Francis and Nicholas and the Crown Prince of Prussia met at M&uuml;nchengr&auml;tz
in Bohemia, where a secret convention was signed on the 18th. They refused
to recognise Isabella as Queen of Spain in the event of Ferdinand's death;
they arranged for mutual assistance against the Poles; and agreed to
combine to resist<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span> any change of dynasty in Turkey and any extension of
Arab rule into Europe. In the event of a collapse of the Ottoman empire,
Austria and Russia were to act together in settling the reversion. On
October 15 the three powers signed a further convention at Berlin,
containing one public and two secret articles. The latter recognised the
right, already asserted at Troppau, of intervention in the internal
affairs of a country whose sovereign expressed a desire for foreign
assistance. There can be little doubt that Austria and Russia were in
earnest in their professed desire to maintain the integrity of the Turkish
dominions, but an opinion gained ground in England that they had already
agreed to partition them between themselves.</p>

<p>On January 29, 1834, Austrian mediation bore fruit in a definite treaty
for the evacuation of the Danubian principalities. Russia merely reserved
to herself the appointment of the first hospodar of each principality. The
first act, however, of Alexander Ghika, the new hospodar of Wallachia, was
to forbid any change of statute without the consent of Russia. Silistria
alone remained in Russian hands till a third part of the indemnity should
be paid. The remaining two-thirds Russia consented to abandon. A revolt
among the Syrian mountaineers gave Russia an opportunity of demonstrating
her pacific intentions. The sultan supported the revolt and also sent
troops to conquer Urfa which Ibrahim had neglected to surrender. Russia,
however, refused to support the sultan in an aggressive war, and the
powers negotiated a peace. The Syrian revolt was quelled, and Urfa
surrendered to the sultan. In 1835 the Tsar Nicholas and the new Austrian
emperor, Ferdinand, met at Teplitz where they renewed the agreements
concluded at M&uuml;nchengr&auml;tz. Metternich proposed a conference at Vienna to
settle the eastern question, but the tsar, who really possessed the
decisive voice so long as the question remained open, refused to hear of
this. Finally in September, 1836, the Russian evacuation of Silistria was
obtained by a payment of 30,000,000 piastres, borrowed, for the most part,
in England. The Eastern question now seemed to have entered upon a quieter
phase, and the military reforms which European officers, including Moltke,
afterwards famous in a different region, were carrying out in Turkey, gave
promise that she might be able to hold her own in future against domestic
foes.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX"></a>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>

<h3>BRITISH INDIA.</h3>


<p><a name="TOPIC_311" id="TOPIC_311"></a>When Pitt resigned office in 1801, the Marquis Wellesley had already
reached the climax, though by no means the close, of his brilliant
proconsulate. This remarkable man, whose fame has been unduly eclipsed by
that of his younger brother, may justly be considered the second founder
of our Indian Empire. This empire, recognised at last, in the vote of
thanks passed by the house of commons on the fall of Seringapatam, was
soon to be aggrandised by three important accessions of dominion. The
first of these was the annexation of the Karn&aacute;tik on the well-founded plea
that its nabob was too weak even for the semblance of independence, that
he was incapable of governing tolerably, and that he had been in
correspondence with Tip&uacute;. The effect of this and two minor annexations was
to place the entire south-western and south-eastern coasts of the Indian
peninsula under the British rule. The next step was the system of
subsidiary treaties, whereby the British government assumed a protectorate
over native states, providing a fixed number of troops for their defence
and receiving an equivalent in subsidies. The Niz&aacute;m of Haidar&aacute;b&aacute;d was
already in a condition little removed from vassalage, and now surrendered
considerable districts in lieu of a pecuniary tribute.</p>

<p>A similar course was taken with the Naw&aacute;b Waz&iacute;r of Oudh whose territory
was threatened on one side by the Afgh&aacute;n king, Zem&aacute;n Sh&aacute;h, and on another
by the Mar&aacute;th&aacute; lord, Daulat R&aacute;o Sindhia, who had gained possession of
Delhi. By forcible negotiations Wellesley obtained from him the cession of
all his frontier provinces, including Rohilkhand, and consolidated the
power of the Indian government along the whole line<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span> of the Jumna and
Ganges. The last and greatest object of the governor-general's ambition
was the conquest of the confederate Mar&aacute;th&aacute; states, and for this a pretext
was not long wanting. His forward policy, it is true, had already excited
alarm and criticism at home, while the peace of Amiens had ostensibly
removed the chief justification of it&mdash;the necessity of combating the
aggressive designs of France. But, in the case of India, far more than of
the American colonies, "months passed and seas rolled between the order
and the execution"; for in those days ships conveying despatches occupied
at least four or five months on their voyage, and decisions taken in
Leadenhall Street might be utterly stultified by accomplished facts before
they could be read in Calcutta.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>WELLESLEY AND LAKE.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_312" id="TOPIC_312"></a>The Peshw&aacute;, at Poona, still maintained a show of independent authority
over the other great Mar&aacute;th&aacute; chieftains, Sindhia, Holkar, and the R&aacute;j&aacute; of
N&aacute;gpur or Ber&aacute;r. But the real military power of the Mar&aacute;th&aacute;s rested with
these leaders, and their predatory troops of horsemen terrorised all
Central India. Happily for Wellesley's purpose, they were often at feud
with each other, and the Peshw&aacute;, though aided by Sindhia, was utterly
defeated by Jaswant R&aacute;o Holkar. He fled to Bassein near Bombay, where, on
December 31, 1802, a treaty was signed by which not only the Peshw&aacute; but
the Niz&aacute;m of Haidar&aacute;b&aacute;d was placed under British protection. The Peshw&aacute;
was conducted back to Poona by a British force under Arthur Wellesley in
May, 1803, but the other Mar&aacute;th&aacute; chiefs naturally resented this fresh
encroachment on their independence, and a league was shortly formed
between the R&aacute;j&aacute; of N&aacute;gpur and Sindhia, which it was hoped that Holkar
would ultimately join. By this time, a rupture of the peace with France
was known to be impending, and Lord Wellesley eagerly seized the
opportunity to crush Sindhia, while he urged the home government to seize
the Cape of Good Hope and the Mauritius. Two expeditions were directed
against Sindhia's territory, the one under Arthur Wellesley, moving from
Poona in the west towards the Niz&aacute;m's frontier; the other, under General
Lake, operating on the north-west against the highly trained forces, under
French officers, assembled before Delhi. Both campaigns were eminently
successful. Wellesley captured Ahmadnagar on August 11, encountered the
combined armies of Sindhia and the R&aacute;j&aacute;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span> of N&aacute;gpur at Assaye on September
23, and, after a desperate conflict, obtained a decisive victory. Twelve
hundred of the Mar&aacute;th&aacute;s were left dead on the field and 102 guns were
captured. He then advanced into Ber&aacute;r and completely defeated the army of
the N&aacute;gpur R&aacute;j&aacute; at Arg&aacute;um. Lake marched from Cawnpur, took Delhi and Agra,
assuming custody of the Mughal emperor, and inflicted a final defeat on a
powerful Mar&aacute;th&aacute; army, no longer under French officers, at Lasw&aacute;ri. Large
cessions of territory followed. The treaty of Bassein was recognised by
Sindhia and the R&aacute;j&aacute; of N&aacute;gpur. Gujr&aacute;t, Cuttack, and the districts along
the Jumna passed into British possession, and the East India Company
became the visible successor, though nominally the guardian, of the Mughal
emperor.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_313" id="TOPIC_313"></a>Meanwhile, Holkar remained a passive spectator of the contest. Jealous as
he was of Sindhia, he was by no means prepared to acquiesce in the
subjection of the great Mar&aacute;th&aacute; power. Having taken up a threatening
position in R&aacute;jput&aacute;na, and defied Lake's summons to retire, he was treated
as an enemy, and proved a very formidable enemy. Instead of relying, like
Sindhia, on disciplined battalions, he fell back on the old Mar&aacute;th&aacute;
tactics, and swept the country with hordes of irregular cavalry who lived
by pillage. In 1804 a British force of 1,200 troops under Colonel Monson
was lured away from its base of supplies by a feigned retreat and incurred
a very serious reverse; scarcely a tenth of them, utterly broken,
"straggled, a mere rabble, into Agra". This disaster was soon afterwards
retrieved by other divisions of Lake's army, but three attempts to storm
the strong fortress of Bhartpur were repulsed by the r&aacute;j&aacute;, Ranj&iacute;t Singh,
an ally of Holkar. Though Holkar's bands were at last dispersed, a new
dispute arose with Sindhia about the ownership of Gwalior and Gohad, which
remained unsettled when Lord Wellesley resigned early in 1805, not so much
because his policy was disapproved by the court of directors, for whom he
always professed a sovereign contempt, as because he was no longer
cordially supported by the home government.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_314" id="TOPIC_314"></a>In his despatch to the secret committee of the East India Company after
the conclusion of the war with Sindhia, Wellesley describes the
consolidation of the British empire and the pacification of all India, as
the supreme result of his benefi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>cent rule.<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> That rule was followed by
ten years of comparative repose, if not of reaction, but two events,
occurring within this period, threw a significant light on the inherent
danger of relying too much on a native army under British officers. Sepoy
regiments had been raised and had served loyally on both sides in the
struggles between the French and English during the eighteenth century.
The Bengal sepoys were mostly R&aacute;jputs and showed the highest military
qualities in many a wearisome march and hard fought field, from the days
of Clive to those of Lake and Arthur Wellesley. But outbreaks bordering
upon mutiny had occasionally taken place in the native armies of all the
presidencies, and on July 10, 1806, a most formidable mutiny, ending in a
massacre at Vellore, west of Madras, produced a sense of insecurity
throughout all India. It was instigated by the family of Tip&uacute; who had been
quartered in that fortress, and its immediate origin was the issue of
certain vexatious regulations about uniform which offended native
prejudices of caste. The European force, numbering some 370, was surprised
and surrounded by a much larger body of sepoys, half of them were killed
or wounded, and Tip&uacute;'s standard was hoisted. Within a few hours, however,
cavalry and artillery arrived from Arcot, the mutineers were slaughtered
by hundreds, and the disaffected regiments were broken up. Three years
later, a serious mutiny broke out among the company's own officers at
Madras, caused by a petty grievance affecting their profits on
tent-contracts. It was appeased rather than suppressed, and,
notwithstanding these discouraging symptoms of insecurity, the Company's
army retained its separate organisation for half a century longer.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>MINTO'S PACIFIC POLICY.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_315" id="TOPIC_315"></a>Lord Cornwallis, the successor of Lord Wellesley, was opposed by
conviction to a progressive expansion of British territory, and
represented not only the cautious views of the home government, but the
financial anxieties of the East India Company, which always valued a
steady revenue more highly than imperial supremacy. Wellesley had
virtually reconstructed the map of India on lines destined to endure until
a fresh period of annexation set in some forty years later. These lines
were not disturbed by Cornwallis, who died on October 5, 1805, three
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span>months after his arrival, but he clearly indicated his desire to let the
system of protectorates and subsidiary treaties fall gradually into
abeyance. His correspondence with Lake, whose victories had won him the
rank of baron, contains a somewhat peremptory warning against fresh
engagements contemplated by that enterprising officer, whose vigorous
remonstrance he did not live to receive.<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> Sir George Barlow, who
became acting governor-general for two years, adopted the same passive
attitude, and forebore to carry out a projected alliance with Sindhia,
though he would not allow any interference with our paramount influence at
Poona and Haidar&aacute;b&aacute;d. Lord Minto, father of the Earl of Minto who presided
at the admiralty under Melbourne, arrived as governor-general in 1807. He
was imbued with similar ideas, and was fortunate in finding the Mar&aacute;th&aacute;s
too much weakened to be dangerous neighbours. His rule was, therefore,
essentially pacific, but he did good service in maintaining internal
order, and especially in putting down the organised brigandage, known as
"dak&aacute;iti," which had been the curse of rural districts. The distinctive
feature of his career, however, was a permanent enlargement of the horizon
of Indian statesmanship to a sphere beyond the confines of India and even
of Asia, a change due to new movements in the vast international conflict
then engrossing the energies of Europe.</p>

<p>However chimerical the designs of Napoleon against British India may now
appear, there is no doubt that such designs were seriously entertained by
him, nor is it self-evident that what Alexander the Great found possible
would have proved impossible to one who combined with Alexander's
superhuman audacity the command of resources beyond anything known in the
ancient world. At all events, after the battle of Friedland and the peace
of Tilsit, an expedition to be launched from Russian territory upon the
north-west frontier of India, with the support of Persia on the flank,
became a contingency which an Indian governor-general could not afford to
neglect. It is, indeed, strange that a march across Europe and half of
Asia should have appeared to Napoleon more practicable than a voyage
across the English Channel, and it is highly improbable that he would have
cherished the idea of it, if he could have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span> foreseen the perils of the
Russian expedition. But his conversations at St. Helena prove that it was
not a mere vision but a half-formed design, and, even after it had been
discouraged by Russia, he sent a preliminary mission to Persia. Minto lost
no time in sending counter-missions, not only to Tihran, but to Lahore,
Afgh&aacute;nist&aacute;n, and Sind.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_316" id="TOPIC_316"></a>The Persian court was already in diplomatic relations with the Indian
government. Colonel Malcolm, afterwards Sir John Malcolm, had been sent by
Wellesley as envoy to the sh&aacute;h at the end of 1800, and in January, 1801, a
treaty had been signed, establishing free trade between India and Persia,
and binding the sh&aacute;h to exclude the French from his dominions, while the
company undertook to provide ships, troops, and stores, in case of French
invasion. This treaty, however, neither was nor could have been actively
carried out on either side. Early in 1806 the sh&aacute;h, who had become
embroiled with Russia, appealed to Calcutta for aid, regardless of the
fact that hostilities with Russia were not a <i>casus f&oelig;deris</i>. Failing
to obtain it, he appealed to France. Napoleon despatched General Gardane,
who arrived in December, 1807. He obtained a treaty under which the sh&aacute;h
engaged to banish all Englishmen on demand of the French emperor.
Thereupon Malcolm was entrusted by Minto with a fresh mission, but never
reached the Persian capital, where French influence was still paramount,
and the peremptory tone of Malcolm's letters was resented. Meanwhile, Sir
Harford Jones had been sent out by the British foreign office, and was
received at Tihran in February, 1809, the peace of Tilsit having destroyed
the Persian hope of French support against Russia. For a while, the right
of negotiating with the sh&aacute;h was in dispute between the Indian government
and the foreign office, and Sir John Malcolm reappeared at Tihran in the
spring of 1810, as the representative of the former. In the end, however,
he co-operated loyally with Jones, and a fresh treaty was signed, though
both these rival emissaries were soon afterwards superseded by Sir Gore
Ouseley as permanent ambassador.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>ELPHINSTONE IN AFGH&Aacute;NIST&Aacute;N.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_317" id="TOPIC_317"></a>Two other envoys selected by Minto left names which are famous in
Anglo-Indian history, and one achieved an important success. Charles
Metcalfe, Minto's envoy to Lahore, succeeded with the advantage of an
armed force within easy reach<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span> of the Sikh frontier, in converting into an
ally the redoubtable Ranj&iacute;t Singh (not to be confounded with Ranj&iacute;t Singh
of Bhartpur), who had gathered into his own hands the Sikh confederacy and
acquired sovereignty over the whole Punjab. He was now induced not only to
accept the Sutlej river as the boundary line of his dominion, but to
conclude a treaty of perpetual amity with the British government. This
treaty remained unbroken until his death, and stood us in good stead
during the perilous crisis of the first Afgh&aacute;n war. The embassy of
Mountstuart Elphinstone to Afgh&aacute;nist&aacute;n was comparatively fruitless,
chiefly owing to the unsettled state of that mysterious country. Sh&aacute;h
Shuj&aacute;, its titular am&iacute;r, so far from being in a condition to resist French
invasion, had lost possession of K&aacute;bul and Kandah&aacute;r, and was only anxious
to obtain British aid against his elder brother Mahm&uacute;d. Elphinstone, of
course, had no authority to entangle the Company in a civil war far beyond
the Indian frontier and was obliged to content himself with a worthless
treaty empowering Great Britain to defend Afgh&aacute;nist&aacute;n against France. This
treaty had scarcely been ratified when Sh&aacute;h Shuj&aacute; himself was driven into
exile, to play an ignoble part thirty years later in the great tragedy of
the first Afgh&aacute;n war.</p>

<p>However pacific Minto's policy was, he did not shut his eyes to the
necessity of guarding the coasts and commerce of India against the enemy
who still dominated Europe, and had not wholly abandoned his visions of
eastern conquest. We have seen already that the "half way" naval station
at the Cape of Good Hope had been retaken from the Dutch in 1806, the year
in which the Berlin decree was issued. In 1810 the French were expelled
from Java by an expedition despatched under Minto's orders, though it was
soon to be restored to Holland. In the same year the islands of Mauritius
and Bourbon were captured from the French and the sea route to India was
finally secured. Lord Minto, who was recalled in 1813 and raised to the
dignity of an earl, left India after six years of peaceful government in a
state of tranquillity such as it had never before enjoyed, and the
settlement of the country under British suzerainty appeared to have been
assured. Yet the seeds of fresh trouble were already working, and his
successor was to prove himself a second Wellesley, and add new territories
of great extent to British India.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_318" id="TOPIC_318"></a>Lord Moira, better known by his later title as Marquis of Hastings,
displayed qualities as governor-general of which his previous career had
given no indication. He had already proved himself a good soldier, but he
was a court favourite as well as a somewhat impracticable politician, and
owed his appointment to other influences than his own merit. His arrival
in India nearly coincided with the charter of 1813, which threw open the
India trade, and virtually ushered in a new social era. He was at once
confronted with an empty treasury, on the one hand, and, on the other,
with alarming reports both from the northern frontier and from the central
provinces, still under independent princes of doubtful fidelity. The
earlier part of his nine years' residence in India was engrossed by most
harassing operations against the Nep&aacute;l&iacute;s and the Pind&aacute;r&iacute;s, but these
operations resulted in perfect success, and Hastings was able to show
before he left India that he was eminent alike in civil and in military
administration.</p>

<p>The mountainous region of Nep&aacute;l, lying on the slopes of the Him&aacute;layas
north of Bengal and Oudh, had been occupied by the warlike nation, still
known as the G&uacute;rkhas, whose capital was at Kh&aacute;tm&aacute;ndu. Like the Mar&aacute;th&aacute;s,
they had been in the habit of pillaging British territory as well as Oudh,
and when part of Oudh was annexed by Wellesley, frontier disputes were
added to former grounds of hostility. Minto remonstrated with them sharply
but in vain, and Moira lost no time in declaring war against them. The
first campaign of 1814, which followed, though skilfully conceived by
Moira, who held the office of commander-in-chief, was carried out with
little generalship, and was marked by disasters highly damaging to British
prestige. Three out of four armies launched against the hill-tribes met
with serious reverses, chiefly due to a contempt for the enemy, and a
persistence in making frontal assaults on strong positions without
practicable breaches, which have proved so fatal in many a later conflict
between British troops and undisciplined foes. During the cold season,
however, on the extreme north-west, the cautious but irresistible advance
of General Ochterlony penetrated the hill ranges which had baffled all the
other commanders, and retrieved the fortunes of the war. The G&uacute;rkhas were
far, indeed, from being subdued, but Ochterlony's success among their
strongest fastnesses, aided by that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span> of Colonels Gardner and Nicholls in
the district of Kum&aacute;un, induced them to sue for peace, and offer
territorial cessions. The loss of the Tar&aacute;i, or belt of forest
interspersed with pastures at the foot of the Him&aacute;layas, was the most
onerous of the conditions imposed upon them by the treaty of Almora,
signed in 1815. Rather than submit to it, the G&uacute;rkha chiefs refused to
ratify the treaty, and resumed their arms. After two defeats, however, in
February, 1816, they abandoned further resistance, and Moira afterwards
wisely consented to a modification of the frontier-line. Retaining but a
remnant of their dominions in the lowlands, the G&uacute;rkhas have ever since
preserved their independence with their military training in the
highlands, and have contributed some of the best fighting material to the
British army in India.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE PIND&Aacute;R&Iacute;S.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_319" id="TOPIC_319"></a>While the war in Nep&aacute;l was still undecided, fresh troubles broke out in
Central India, where Wellesley's settlement had left no permanent security
for peace. The very submission of the great Mar&aacute;th&aacute; powers had set free
large bands of irregular troops, with no livelihood but pillage, and ever
ready, like the Italian <i>condottieri</i> of the later middle ages, to enlist
in the service of any aggressive state. These mounted freebooters, now
called the Pind&aacute;r&iacute;s, were secretly encouraged by the Mar&aacute;th&aacute; chiefs, who
looked upon them as useful auxiliaries in the future, either against the
government of India or against other native princes. Several of these
still remained in a more or less dependent but restless condition, and the
great leaders of the Mar&aacute;th&aacute; confederacy, Sindhia, Malh&aacute;r R&aacute;o Holkar, son
and successor of Jaswant R&aacute;o, the Peshw&aacute;, and the R&aacute;j&aacute; of N&aacute;gpur, retained
a large share of their former sovereignty. Of these subject-allies, the
one most directly under British guidance and protection was the Peshw&aacute;,
but even he took advantage of hostile movements among his neighbours to
join in a combination against British rule, supported by the predatory
raids of the Pind&aacute;r&iacute;s. He had long been discontented with the subordinate
position which he had occupied since the treaty of Bassein. The
assassination in 1815 of an envoy of the G&aacute;ekw&aacute;r of Baroda, who had been
sent to Poona on a special mission under British guarantees, nearly
provoked hostilities. But in June, 1817, a treaty was concluded, by which
the Peshw&aacute; accepted an increased subsidiary force,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span> ceded part of his
territory, renounced his suzerainty over the G&aacute;ekw&aacute;r and undertook to
submit all further disputes to the decision of the British government. In
November, however, chafing under the restrictions imposed by this treaty,
he broke out into hostility, burnt the British residency, and after vainly
attacking the British troops, fled from Poona. Almost simultaneously
Holkar and the R&aacute;j&aacute; of N&aacute;gpur rose. Holkar was defeated in a pitched
battle at Mehidpur in M&aacute;lw&aacute;, while the sepoys successfully held their own
against the R&aacute;j&aacute;'s troops at N&aacute;gpur. The fugitive Peshw&aacute; was energetically
pursued, and captured, and was stripped of his dominions. The greater part
of these was annexed by the East India Company, but a portion was reserved
for the heir of the old Mar&aacute;th&aacute; kings who was established at S&aacute;t&aacute;ra. The
R&aacute;j&aacute; of N&aacute;gpur was also compelled to cede a large portion of his
dominions, and at the same time the Company acquired the overlordship of
R&aacute;jput&aacute;na. Henceforth, the British government claimed a control over all
the foreign relations of native Indian states, whose internal government
was to be carefully watched by a British resident, and whose military
forces were to be practically under the supreme command of the paramount
power.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE END OF THE PIND&Aacute;R&Iacute;S.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_320" id="TOPIC_320"></a>Lord Moira, created Marquis of Hastings in 1816, was at last free to hunt
down the Pind&aacute;r&iacute;s, with the sullen acquiescence of the Mar&aacute;th&aacute;
governments, and he executed his task with extraordinary vigour. He would
have undertaken it, at the instigation of Metcalfe, then resident at
Delhi, a year earlier, but for the peremptory orders of Canning, at that
time president of the board of control, who positively forbade him to
embark on a new war. These orders were greatly relaxed after the
bloodthirsty raid of Ch&iacute;tu, the famous Pind&aacute;r&iacute; leader, who in 1816
desolated vast tracts of Central India. Still no effective action against
the Pind&aacute;r&iacute;s was possible until the Mar&aacute;th&aacute; lords who harboured and
encouraged them had been crippled and overawed. With their connivance, a
second Pind&aacute;r&iacute; raid, accompanied by shocking cruelties, was made in the
same year, but in 1817, when Holkar's followers were severely defeated at
Mehidpur, the secret coalition between these bandits and our nominal
allies was thoroughly broken up. Even then it proved a most difficult
enterprise to root out the Pind&aacute;r&iacute;s, who were not a race, or a tribe, or a
sect, but bands of lawless<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span> men of all faiths; for they met and vanished
like birds of the air, outstripping regular cavalry by the length and
rapidity of their marches, and carrying off their booty almost under the
eyes of their pursuers. But the resolute tactics of Hastings prevailed in
the end. Am&iacute;r Kh&aacute;n, their most powerful leader, disbanded his troops; and
hemmed in on all sides, cut off from every place of shelter, and chased by
successive detachments of horsemen almost as fleet as his own, Ch&iacute;tu
became a hopeless fugitive, with a handful of faithful adherents, who
shared his desperate efforts to escape, but advised him to surrender. He
could not bring himself to do so, possessed, it is said, with an
unspeakable horror of being transported across "the black sea," and he
actually remained at large or in hiding for a year after his lair was
discovered. Nor was he ever captured, for, by a strange fate, this
ruthless scourge of the Deccan, after baffling human vengeance, found his
last refuge in a jungle and died, a tiger's prey. By this time, all the
wild bands which sprung into existence out of the Mar&aacute;th&aacute; war had been
extirpated or dispersed, and after the year 1818 the dreaded name of
Pind&aacute;r&iacute; was heard no more in history.</p>

<p>The suppression of civil war and anarchy in Central India, which completed
the work of Wellesley, was the greatest achievement of Hastings. One
remarkable incident of it was a portentous outbreak of cholera in 1817,
during a campaign in Gwalior conducted by Hastings in person. There had
been several minor visitations of this disease in India. But it now first
established itself as an endemic disease, and it has ever since infested
the valley of the Ganges. So virulent was its onslaught, and so fearful
the mortality in Hastings' army, that it was only saved by shifting its
quarters, and the governor-general himself made preparations for his own
secret burial, in case he should be among the victims. As we have seen
already,<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> it was propagated from this centre through other regions of
Asia, until it spread to Western Europe, and the "Asiatic cholera" of
1831-32 may be lineally traced back to the last Mar&aacute;th&aacute; war.</p>

<p>The position of Hastings in Indian history closely resembles that of
Wellesley. Disregarding the instructions of the board of control, as well
as of the board of directors, he forced upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span> them, like Wellesley, a
large extension of their empire. But it cannot be doubted that his policy,
dictated by exigencies beyond the ken of authorities sitting in London,
was eminently successful and beneficent in its results. It went far to
establish a "Pax Britannica" in the Indian Peninsula, and, if it took
little account of dynastic rights, it broke the rod of oppression, and
relieved millions upon millions from tyranny and intimidation which
overshadowed their whole lives. He retired in 1823, after seven years'
tenure of office, and died in 1826 as governor of Malta. Canning had been
designated as his successor, and, having accepted the post, was on the eve
of starting for Calcutta, when the tragical death of Castlereagh recalled
him to the foreign office, and opened to him the most brilliant stage in
his career. Thereupon Lord Amherst was appointed governor-general, with
every prospect of a pacific vice-royalty, whereas it is now chiefly
remembered for the annexation of new provinces on the south-east of
Bengal, and the capture of Bhartpur.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE FIRST BURMESE WAR.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_321" id="TOPIC_321"></a>The first Burmese war arose out of persistent aggressions by the new
kingdom of Ava or Burma on what is now the British province of Assam, but
was then an independent, though feeble, state. There had been earlier
frontier disputes between the Indian government and Burma about the
districts lying eastward of Chittagong along the Bay of Bengal, but it was
not until Burma conquered Arakan, invaded Assam, and occupied passes on
the north-east overlooking the plains of Bengal, that serious action was
felt to be necessary. Indeed, while Hastings was engaged with the war in
Nep&aacute;l and the suppression of the Pind&aacute;r&iacute;s, even he was in no mood to
embark on a fresh campaign beyond the borders of India. The incursions of
the Burmese, however, became more and more threatening both on the coast
line and on the mountains above the Brahmaputra river, and in February,
1824, Amherst resolved to check the extension of their dominion.
Notwithstanding the experience recently gained in Nep&aacute;l, the first
operations of the Anglo-Indian troops were conducted with little knowledge
of the country, and met with very doubtful success. Rangoon was easily
captured, but the expedition was disabled from advancing up the river
Irawadi by the want of adequate supplies and the deadliness of the
climate. Part of the Tenasserim coast was subdued, but a British force was
defeated in Arakan.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span> These reverses were retrieved in the following year,
1825, when one army under Sir Archibald Campbell made its way up the river
to Prome, while another army conquered Arakan, and a third, moving along
the valley of the Brahmaputra, established itself in Assam. The Burmese
now abandoned further resistance. Assam, Arakan, and the Tenasserim
provinces were ceded to the company, whose protectorate was also
recognised over other territories upon the course of the Brahmaputra. It
was not until February, 1826, that the King of Ava could be induced to
sign the treaty embodying these cessions, and many years were to elapse
before the port of Rangoon was opened to British commerce.</p>

<p>The strong fortress of Bhartpur, in the east of R&aacute;jput&aacute;na, and near to
Agra, had acquired an unique importance, in the eyes of all India by its
successful resistance to Lake's assaults during the Mar&aacute;th&aacute; war of 1805.
It was still held until 1825 by its own petty r&aacute;j&aacute;, the son of Ranj&iacute;t
Singh, who remained on terms of respectful amity with the Indian
government, though his little principality was a notorious focus of native
disaffection. In that year he died, and his child, after being
acknowledged by the Indian government as his successor, was forcibly
ousted by a usurper. Sir David Ochterlony, the hero of the Nep&aacute;lese war,
then resident in M&aacute;lw&aacute; and R&aacute;jput&aacute;na, undertook to support the legitimate
heir, but was overruled by orders from Amherst. On his resignation he was
succeeded by Metcalfe, who had become Sir Charles Metcalfe by his
brother's death in 1822, and who now obtained authority to carry out
Ochterlony's policy, if necessary, by armed intervention. As negotiation
failed, Lord Combermere, as commander-in-chief, proceeded to reduce the
virgin fortress, not by the slow process of siege, but by a well-organised
assault. Having cut off the water supply, and mined the mud walls, he
poured in a storming party and overpowered the garrison. The feat was
probably not so great, from a military point of view, as many that have
left no record, but its effect on the superstitious native mind was
prodigious, especially as it nearly coincided with the victorious issue of
the Burmese war. Nevertheless, Amherst was shortly afterwards recalled,
and left India in 1828. His annexation of Burmese territory and the
increase of expenditure under his rule displeased both the Company and the
home government, so often<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span> foiled in the attempt to enforce a pacific and
economical policy. His successor was Lord William Bentinck, who had been
compelled to retire from the governorship of Madras after the mutiny of
Vellore.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_322" id="TOPIC_322"></a>Like Hastings, Bentinck showed a firmness and wisdom in his Indian
administration strongly contrasting with the restless self-assertion of
his earlier career. His lot was cast in an interval of tranquillity after
a long period of warfare, and his name is associated with internal reforms
and social progress in India, not unconnected with a like movement in
England. The measure upon which his fame chiefly rests was the abolition
of "sat&iacute;," that is, the practice of Hindoo widows sacrificing themselves
by being burned alive on the funeral pile of their husbands. This
practice, which specially prevailed in Bengal, has been explained by a
false interpretation of certain texts in sacred books of the Hindus, by
the selfish eagerness of the husband's family to monopolise all his
property, and by the utterly desolate condition of a childless widow in
native communities. At all events, it was deeply rooted in Hindu
traditions, and no previous governor had dared to go beyond issuing
regulations to secure that the widow should be a willing victim. Bentinck
had the courage to act on the conviction that inhumanity, however
consecrated by superstition and priestcraft, has no permanent basis in
popular sentiment. With the consent of his council, he prohibited "sat&iacute;"
absolutely, declaring that all who took any part in it should be held
guilty of culpable homicide; and the native population acquiesced in its
suppression.</p>

<p>But this was only one of Bentinck's reforms. Armed with peremptory
instructions from the home government, he effected large retrenchments in
the growing expenditure of the Indian services, both civil and military,
and a considerable increase in the Indian revenue. It may be doubted
whether one of these retrenchments, involving a strict revision of
officers' allowances known as "batta," was considerable enough to be worth
the almost mutinous discontent which it provoked. Another, affecting the
salaries of civilians, was aggravated, in their eyes, by the admission of
natives to "primary jurisdiction," in other words, by enabling native
judges to sit in courts of first instance. This important change had been
gradually introduced before the arrival of Bentinck, but it was he who
most boldly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span> adopted the idea of governing India in the interest and by
the agency of the natives. On the other hand, it was he who, supported by
Macaulay's famous minute, but contrary to official opinion in Leadenhall
Street, issued the ordinance constituting English the official language of
India. In a like spirit, he promoted the work of native education, partly
for the purpose of developing the political and judicial capacity of the
higher orders among the Hindus, but partly also for the purpose of making
the English language and literature the instrument of their elevation. He
earnestly desired to raise the standard of Indian civilisation, but he
equally desired to fashion it in an English mould.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>THE EXTIRPATION OF "THAG&Iacute;".</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_323" id="TOPIC_323"></a>Under the rule of Bentinck, the revenue was largely augmented by a
reassessment of land in the north-western provinces, where an increasing
number of zam&iacute;nd&aacute;rs had fraudulently evaded the payment of rent, and by
the imposition of licence-duties on the growers of opium in M&aacute;lw&aacute;, who had
carried on a profitable but illicit trade through foreign ports. But the
social benefit of the people was ever his first concern, and not the least
of his claims to their gratitude was the final extirpation of "thag&iacute;".
This institution was a secret association of highway robbers and murderers
who had plagued Central India almost as widely as the roving troops of
Pind&aacute;r&iacute;s. Their victims were travellers whom they decoyed into their
haunts, plundered, strangled, and buried on the spot. For years they
carried on their infamous trade with impunity, and no member of the
conspiracy had turned informer. At last, however, a clue was found by a
skilful and resolute agent of the government, and the spell of mutual
dread which held together the murderous confederacy was effectually broken
in India. Meanwhile, the same period of peaceful development witnessed the
execution of important public works, the relaxation of restrictions on the
liberty of the press, and a general advance towards a more paternal
despotism, coincident with the progress of liberal ideas at home. These
benign influences were favoured by the continuance of peace and the
maintenance of non-intervention, disturbed only by the minor annexations
of Cachar and Coorg, to which may be added the assumption of direct
control over Mysore.</p>

<p>When the charter of 1833 transformed the "company of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span> British merchants
trading to the east" into the "East India Company," with administrative
powers only, Bentinck was in failing health, and he soon afterwards
returned home. On his resignation in 1835, Metcalfe became provisional
governor-general, but his liberal policy displeased the court of
directors, and Lord Heytesbury was selected by the short-lived government
of Peel as Bentinck's successor. Palmerston, however, on resuming the
foreign office, was believed to have used his influence to set aside this
nomination, and to procure the appointment of Lord Auckland, then first
lord of the admiralty. The supposed objection to Heytesbury was his known
sympathy with Russia, at a moment when distrust of Russia's designs on the
north-west frontier was about to become the keynote of Anglo-Indian
statesmanship. During the interregnum between Bentinck's retirement and
Auckland's accession, three more remedial measures were carried into
effect, the wisdom of which is not even yet beyond dispute. These were the
complete liberation of the Indian press, the abolition of the exclusive
privilege whereby British residents could appeal in civil suits to the
supreme court at Calcutta, and the definite introduction of English
text-books into schools for the people. For all these reforms Macaulay was
largely responsible, but the impulse had been given by Bentinck, and was
accelerated by Metcalfe.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_324" id="TOPIC_324"></a>During the years 1835-37 domestic affairs occupied much less space in the
counsels of Indian statesmen than schemes for counteracting the growth of
Russian influence at Tihran, and securing the predominance of British
influence in Afgh&aacute;nist&aacute;n. For a time their anxiety was concentrated on
Herat, which the Sh&aacute;h of Persia was besieging, with the intention of
penetrating into the heart of Afgh&aacute;n territory, while the Afgh&aacute;n rulers
themselves were suspected of secretly conspiring with Persia against our
ally, Ranj&iacute;t Singh. Since Persia, having again lost faith in British
support, was drifting more and more into reliance on Russia, this forward
movement was regarded as the first step of the Russian advance-guard
towards India. The fate of India was felt to depend on the defence of
Herat under Pottinger, a young British officer, who volunteered his
services without instructions from home. The siege, conducted under
Russian officers, lasted ten months, and its ultimate failure was hailed
as a triumph of British policy, for Herat was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span> recognised, since the days
of Alexander the Great, as the western gate of India.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>COMMUNICATION WITH INDIA.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_325" id="TOPIC_325"></a>About the same time the question of a shorter route to India attracted
much attention both in Russia and in England. The first project was that,
ultimately adopted, of a sea passage by Malta to Alexandria, a land
transit across Egypt to Suez, and a second voyage by the Red Sea to Indian
ports. The alternative line was more properly described as an "overland
route," since it was proposed to make the journey from some port in the
eastern Levant across Syria and by the Euphrates to the Persian Gulf.
Colonel Chesney was sent out in 1835 as the pioneer of an expedition by
this route, and parliament twice voted money for its development, but it
was vigorously opposed by Russia, and abandoned as impracticable owing to
physical difficulties in navigating the Euphrates, then considered as a
necessary channel of communication with the sea. The scheme has since been
revived on a much grander scale in the form of a projected railway
traversing Asia Minor to Baghdad, and running down the valley of the
Tigris. In the meantime, the Red Sea route, at first discredited, has far
more than justified the hopes of its promoters. With the aid of
steam-vessels, since 1845, and of the Suez Canal, since 1869, it has
reduced the journey to India from a period of four months to one of three
weeks, and profoundly affected its relations with Great Britain.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_326" id="TOPIC_326"></a>It would be well if the premature, but not unfounded, fear of Russian
invasion had produced no further effects on Anglo-Indian policy.
Unhappily, those who justly perceived the importance of Afgh&aacute;nist&aacute;n, as
lying between Persia and the Punjab, were possessed with the delusion that
it would prove a more solid buffer as a British dependency than as an
independent state. In their ignorance of its internal condition and the
sentiments of its unruly tribes, the Indian government despatched Sir
Alexander Burnes to K&aacute;bul, nominally as a commercial emissary, but not
without ulterior objects. They could not have chosen a more capable agent,
for he added to a knowledge of several languages a minute geographical
acquaintance with Central Asia and an insight into the character of its
inhabitants which probably no other Englishman possessed. He was to
proceed by way of Sind to Pesh&aacute;war, and in passing through<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span> Sind he
received news of the siege of Herat, the significance of which he was not
slow to appreciate. Thenceforward his mission inevitably assumed a
political complexion, since the future of Afgh&aacute;nist&aacute;n became a practical
question. His rash negotiations with Dost Muhammad, the Am&iacute;r of K&aacute;bul, and
his brother at Kandah&aacute;r, his return to India, his second mission to
Afgh&aacute;nist&aacute;n in support of a policy which he had deprecated, and his
tragical death in the K&aacute;bul insurrection,&mdash;these are events which belong
to a later chapter of history. But, though Burnes cannot be held
responsible for the first Afgh&aacute;n war, there can be no doubt that his
travels in disguise through Central Asia, and confidential reports on the
border countries between the Russian and British spheres of influence,
were the immediate prelude to a campaign the most ill-advised and the most
disastrous ever organised by the Indian government and sanctioned by that
of Great Britain.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX"></a>CHAPTER XX.</h2>

<h3>LITERATURE AND SOCIAL PROGRESS.</h3>


<p>The period which elapsed between the resignation of Pitt and the battle of
Waterloo was hardly less eventful in the history of British civilisation
than in the history of British empire. To some, the boundary line between
the society of the eighteenth and that of the nineteenth century appears
to be marked by the outbreak of the French revolution, and the
far-reaching effects of that catastrophe upon ideas, manners, and politics
in Great Britain, as well as upon the continent, are too evident to be
denied. But it is equally certain that, before the French revolution, an
intellectual and industrial movement was in progress which must have given
a most powerful impulse to civilisation, even if the French revolution had
never taken place. In this country, especially, the great writers,
philanthropists, scientific leaders, inventors, engineers, and reformers
of various types, who adorned the latter part of George III.'s reign,
largely drew their inspiration from an age, just preceding the French
revolution, which is sometimes regarded as barren in originality.</p>

<p>When the nineteenth century opened, the classical authors of that
pre-revolutionary age had mostly passed away. Hume died in 1776, Johnson
in 1784, Adam Smith in 1790, Gibbon in 1794, Burns in 1796, Burke in 1797,
Cowper in 1800. John Howard, the great pioneer of prison reform, became a
martyr to philanthropy in 1790. The most remarkable of those manufacturing
improvements and mechanical inventions upon which the commercial supremacy
of England is founded date from the same period, and have been described
in a previous volume. Steam navigation was still untried, but preliminary
experiments had already been made on both sides of the Atlantic before
1789. The application of steam to locomotion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span> by land had scarcely been
conceived, but the facilities of traffic and travelling had been vastly
developed in the first forty years of George III.'s reign.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_327" id="TOPIC_327"></a>It may truly be said, however, that English literature in the early party
of the nineteenth century bears clear traces of the influence exercised on
receptive minds by the French revolution. Three of the leading poets,
Coleridge, Wordsworth, and Southey, were deeply infected by its spirit,
and indulged in their youth fantastic dreams of a social millennium;
Wordsworth, especially, who in his maturer years could be justly described
as the priest of nature-worship and the poet of rural life, had imbibed
violent republican ideas during a residence of more than a year in France.
These were passing off in 1798, when he published, jointly with Coleridge,
the volume of <i>Lyrical Ballads</i> containing the latter's immortal tale of
the <i>Ancient Mariner</i>. In the following year he settled in the English
lake-country, where Coleridge established himself for a while, and Southey
for life. Hence the popular but very inaccurate title of the "Lake
School," applied to a trio of poets who, except as friends, had little in
common with each other. Indeed, after Wordsworth had developed his theory
of poetical realism in the preface to a volume published in 1800,
Coleridge rejected and criticised it as wholly untenable. All three,
however, may be considered as comrades in a revolt against the
conventional diction of eighteenth century poetry, from which Coleridge's
"dreamy tenderness" and mystical flights of fancy were as remote as
Wordsworth's rusticity and almost prosaic studies of humble life.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>COLERIDGE AND SCOTT.</i></div>

<p>Although Coleridge survived to 1834 and Wordsworth to 1850, both seem to
have lost at an early date that power of imagination, whether displayed in
sympathy or in creation, in which their greatness consisted. Wordsworth
wrote assiduously during the whole of this period; in 1807 he published a
volume of poems, including the famous <i>Ode on the Intimations of
Immortality</i> and several of his finest sonnets; but of his later work only
an occasional lyric deserves to be ranked beside the poems published in
1800 and 1807. Coleridge, indeed, published two of his finest poems,
<i>Christabel</i> and <i>Kubla Khan</i>, in 1816, but they were written long before,
<i>Christabel</i>, partly in 1797 and partly in 1801, and <i>Kubla Khan</i> in 1798.
Even the new metre<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span> of <i>Christabel</i>, which is not the least of Coleridge's
contributions to English poetry, had, as early as 1805, been borrowed in
the <i>Lay of the Last Minstrel</i> by Scott, to whom Coleridge had recited the
poem. Nevertheless, Coleridge continued to exercise a great influence,
partly through the charm of his conversation and partly through his prose
works, in which he introduced to a British public, as yet unused to German
literature, a vision of that mystical German thought which finds its
father in Kant, and was represented at that day by Hegel in philosophy and
Goethe in poetry. It is uncertain how far the general ignorance of German
literature in England was responsible for the influence exercised in their
own day by the few English or Scottish thinkers, such as Coleridge,
Hamilton, and Carlyle, who had either fallen under the spell or learned
the secret of the German mystics. The most important of Coleridge's prose
works was <i>Aids to Reflection</i>, which appeared in 1828, and whatever be
its literary value, it deserves the notice of the historian, as the least
unsystematic treatise of an author who gave the principal philosophical
impetus to the Oxford movement.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_328" id="TOPIC_328"></a>Two other poets, eminently the product of their age, though not the
offspring of the French revolution, Scott and Byron, were equally in
revolt against conventional diction. Scott elevated ballad-poetry to a
level which it had never before attained, and composed some of the most
beautiful songs in the English language. If it be remembered that he was
cramped by the drudgery of legal offices during the best years of his
life, that he was nearly thirty when he made his first literary venture,
that he was crippled by financial ruin and broken health during his later
years, that his anonymous contributions to periodicals would fill volumes,
and that he died at the age of sixty-one, his fertility of production must
ever be ranked as unique in the history of English literature. Already
known as the author of various lyrical pieces, and the <i>Border
Minstrelsy</i>, he published the <i>Lay of the Last Minstrel</i> in 1805,
<i>Marmion</i> (with its fine stanzas on Pitt and Fox) in 1808, the <i>Lady of
the Lake</i> in 1809, <i>Don Roderick</i> in 1811, and <i>Rokeby</i> in 1813, as well
as minor poems of high merit. He is said to have abandoned poetry in
deference to Byron's rising star, and it is certain that he now fills a
higher place in the roll of English classics as a prose writer than as a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span>
poet. His first novel, <i>Waverley</i>, appeared in 1814, and was followed In
the next four years by six of the greatest "Waverley Novels," as the
series came to be called&mdash;<i>Guy Mannering</i>, the <i>Antiquary</i>, the <i>Black
Dwarf</i>, <i>Old Mortality</i>, <i>Rob Roy</i>, and the <i>Heart of Midlothian</i>. It is
not too much to say that by these works, both in poetry and in prose, he
created the historical romance in Great Britain. The legends of chivalry
and the folk-lore of his native land had deeply stirred his soul, and
fired his imagination from childhood, and though later "research" has far
outstripped the range of his antiquarian knowledge, no modern writer has
ever done so much to awaken a reverence for olden times in the hearts of
his countrymen. The easy flow of his style, the vivid energy of his
thought, the graphic power of his descriptions, his shrewd and robust
sympathy with human nature, and the evident simplicity of his own
character, not unmingled with flashes of true poetical insight, justly
rendered him the most popular writer of his time.</p>

<p>Byron was born in 1788, and first sprang into notice as the author of
<i>English Bards and Scotch Reviewers</i>, a fierce and bitter reply to critics
who had disparaged his first essay in poetry. This satire appeared in
1809, when he was just of age, after which he travelled with Hobhouse, and
it was not until 1812 that he "woke to find himself famous," on publishing
the first two cantos of <i>Childe Harold</i>. During the next three years, he
poured forth a succession of characteristic poems, including the <i>Giaour</i>,
the <i>Bride of Abydos</i>, the <i>Corsair</i>, <i>Lara</i>, and the <i>Siege of Corinth</i>.
His later work was of a more finished order, including the remaining
cantos of <i>Childe Harold</i>, <i>Manfred</i>, <i>Cain</i>, and <i>Mazeppa</i>, and when he
died at Mesolongi in 1824, he left unfinished what is, in some ways, the
most remarkable of his works, <i>Don Juan</i>. Long before his death he had
become the prophet and hero of a pseudo-romantic school, composed of young
Englishmen dazzled by his intellectual brilliancy, and attracted rather
than repelled by a certain Satanic taint in his moral sentiments. But he
also won the admiration of Goethe, and the reaction against his fame in a
later generation is as exaggerated as the idolatry of which he was the
object under the regency. His morbid egotism, his stormy rhetoric, and his
meretricious exaltation of passion, have lost their magical effect, but
his poetical gifts would have commanded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span> homage in any age. The message
which he professed to deliver was a false message, but few poets have
surpassed him in daring vigour of imagination, in descriptive force, in
wit, or in pathos. His style was eminently such as to invite imitation,
yet no one has successfully imitated him. Had he been a better man, and
had his life been prolonged, he might perhaps have towered above his
literary contemporaries as Napoleon did among the generals and rulers of
Europe.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>KEATS, SHELLEY, TENNYSON.</i></div>

<p>Yet among these contemporaries were Keats and Shelley, whom some critics
of a younger generation would place above him in poetical originality.
Their chief merit lay neither in thought nor in strength, but in an
exquisite sweetness of expression, which in the case of Shelley at least
was quite independent of the subject-matter. Keats, though junior to
Shelley, has been described as his poetical father, but his chief poem,
<i>Endymion</i>, did not appear until several years after Shelley had formed
his own distinctive style. He died in 1821 at the age of twenty-six,
leaving a poetical inheritance of the highest quality, which, though
limited in quantity and unequal in workmanship, has gained an enduring
reputation. Nevertheless his work lent itself readily to imitation, and he
exercised a marked influence on the style of later poets, not only in this
period, but in the Victorian age as well. The rebellious spirit of Shelley
had already shown itself at an early age in his poetry, and especially in
<i>Queen Mab</i>, printed in 1812. His ethereal fancy, his dreamy obscurity,
and his witchery of language, designated him from the first as a master of
lyrical poetry; though he wrote longer pieces, his fame rests on the
numerous short poems which continued to appear till his death in 1822.</p>

<p>Perhaps the greatest master of melody was one who was only coming to the
front at the close of this period, Alfred Tennyson, born in 1809,
contributed with two of his brothers to a collection of verses,
misleadingly entitled <i>Poems by Two Brothers</i>, which appeared in 1826. At
Cambridge his <i>Timbuctoo</i> won the chancellor's prize, but the first proof
of his powers was given by a volume of short poems published in 1830,
followed by a similar volume two years later. By far the greater part of
his work lies in the next period, but the volume of 1833 already included
some of his best known poems.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_329" id="TOPIC_329"></a>Among minor poets of this period the highest rank must perhaps be assigned
to Thomas Campbell and Thomas Moore as authors of some of the most
stirring and graceful lyrics in the English language. The former had
attained celebrity by the <i>Pleasures of Hope</i>, published before the end of
the eighteenth century, but his choicest poems, such as <i>Ye Mariners of
England</i>, the fine verses on Hohenlinden and Copenhagen, and <i>Gertrude of
Wyoming</i>, appeared between 1802 and 1809. The series of Moore's Irish
melodies, on which his poetical fame largely rests, was begun in 1807,
though not completed until long afterwards. They were followed by other
lyrical pieces of great merit, and by a series of witty and malicious
lampoons, collected in 1813 into a volume called the <i>Twopenny Post Bag</i>.
<i>Lalla Rookh</i>, his most ambitious effort, was not published until 1817.</p>

<p>Two prose writers of the same epoch, Southey and Bentham, claim special
notice, though Southey may also be numbered among the poets. Having
established himself close to Keswick in 1804, he prosecuted a literary
career with the most untiring industry until his mental faculties at last
failed him some thirty-six years later. During this period he produced
above a hundred volumes in poetry and prose, besides numerous scattered
articles and other papers. Most of these were of merely ephemeral
interest, but the <i>Life of Nelson</i>, published in 1813, may be said to have
set a standard of simplicity, purity, and dignity in English prose which
has been of permanent value. Bentham's style, on the contrary, was so
wanting in beauty and perspicuity that one at least of his chief works is
best known to English readers in the admirable French paraphrase of his
friend Dumont. This is his famous <i>Introduction to the Principles of
Morals and Legislation</i>, in which the doctrines of the utilitarian
philosophy are rigorously applied to jurisprudence and the regulation of
human conduct. Several of his numerous treatises had been planned, and
others actually composed, before the end of the eighteenth century, but
his practical influence, ultimately so great, first made itself felt in
the early part of the nineteenth century. This influence may be compared
within the sphere of social reform to that of Adam Smith within the sphere
of economy. Many amendments of the law, an improved system of prison
discipline, and even the reform of the poor law,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span> may be directly traced
to his counsels, and it was he who inspired the leading radicals when
radicalism was not so much a destructive creed as a protest against real
and gross abuses.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>MALTHUS.</i></div>

<p>Perhaps, next to Bentham, no writer of this period influenced educated
opinion so powerfully as Malthus, whose <i>Essay on Population</i>, first
published anonymously in 1798, attracted comparatively little attention
until 1803, when it was republished in a maturer form. No work has ever
been more persistently misrepresented. While he shows that population, if
unchecked, will surely increase in a ratio far outstripping any possible
increase in the means of subsistence, he also shows, by elaborate proofs,
that it will inevitably be checked by vice and misery, whether or not they
are aided by moral restraint. Later experience has done little to weaken
his reasoning, but it has proved that "moral restraint" (in the most
general sense) operates more widely than he ventured to expect, and that
larger tracts of the earth's surface than he recognised could be brought
under profitable cultivation. With these modifications, his theory holds
the field, and the people of Great Britain only escape starvation by
ever-growing importations of grain from countries whose production&mdash;for
the present&mdash;exceeds their consumption.</p>

<p>Several other writers of eminence, such as Sheridan and Paley, who lived
in the latter days of George III. are more properly to be regarded as
survivors of eighteenth century literature. Horne Tooke was returned for
Old Sarum in 1801, and enjoyed a reputation in society until his death in
1812, but his old-fashioned radicalism had long since been superseded by a
newer creed. Dugald Stewart continued to lecture on moral philosophy until
1809, and was fortunate in numbering among his pupils Palmerston,
Lansdowne, and Russell. A younger student of philosophy was Richard
Whately, who was born in 1787, and elected to a fellowship at Oriel
College, Oxford, in 1811. He soon began to play an active part in
university life, and, after being principal of St. Alban Hall, was removed
to the archbishopric of Dublin in 1831. Though not a great philosopher, he
was an acute logician, and his <i>Logic</i>, published in 1826, entitled him to
a high place among the thinkers of his generation. But it was not merely
as a teacher<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span> and writer that Whately promoted the cause of philosophy in
Oxford. He was one of the leaders in that organisation of studies which
made philosophy one of the principal studies, if not the principal study,
of the abler students in that university, and gave elementary logic a
place in the ordinary "pass-man's" curriculum.</p>

<p>The best work of Maria Edgeworth and Jane Austen appeared in the early
part of the nineteenth century. Maria Edgeworth's novel, <i>Castle
Rackrent</i>, was published in 1800, and rapidly followed by other tales
descriptive of Irish life; four of Jane Austen's novels, <i>Sense and
Sensibility</i>, <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>, <i>Mansfield Park</i>, and <i>Emma</i>, were
published between 1811 and 1816, while <i>Northanger Abbey</i> and <i>Persuasion</i>
appeared after her death in 1817. All her work displays a power of minute
analysis of character shared by few, if any, of our other novelists. Both
authors deserve gratitude not only for having inspired Scott with a new
idea of novel-writing, but for having exercised a purifying influence on
the moral tone of English romance.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_330" id="TOPIC_330"></a>The most typical feature of English literature in the earlier years of the
nineteenth century was the extraordinary development of the periodical and
newspaper press. The eighteenth century was the golden age of pamphlets.
When the "governing classes" represented but a fraction of the population,
mostly concentrated in London, the practical effect of such political
appeals as those issued by Swift or Burke was incredibly great, and not to
be measured by their limited circulation. The rise of journalism as a
power in politics may be roughly dated from the notoriety of Wilkes'
<i>North Briton</i>, and of the letters of "Junius" in the <i>Public Advertiser</i>.
Thenceforward, newspapers, at first mere chronicles of passing events,
inevitably grew to be organs of political opinion, and had now almost
superseded pamphlets, as addressed to a far larger circle of readers.
Notwithstanding the heavy stamp duties, as well as duties on paper and
advertisements, six daily journals were published in London, of which the
<i>Times</i> was already the greatest. Cobbett's <i>Weekly Political Register</i>,
commenced in 1802, was diffusing new ideas among the middle classes, but
it was not yet committed to radicalism, and did not win its way into
cottages until its price was greatly reduced in 1816. After<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span> Cobbett's
death in 1835, it ceased to appear. Still the ice was broken, and, as the
educated public recovered from the panic caused by the French revolution,
the newspaper press became a potent and independent rival of parliament
and the platform.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>EDINBURGH AND QUARTERLY REVIEWS.</i></div>

<p>But the influence of the <i>Edinburgh</i> and <i>Quarterly Reviews</i> was perhaps
even greater among readers of the highest intelligence. The first of these
was founded in 1802 by Jeffrey, Brougham, Horner, and Sydney Smith, but
was supported at first by Scott and other able contributors. So remarkable
a body of writers must have commanded attention in any age, but at a time
when the only periodicals were annuals and miscellanies, the literary
vigour and range of knowledge displayed by the new review carried all
before it. For several years it had an unique success, but, as it
identified itself more and more with the whig party, Canning, with the aid
of Scott, determined to challenge its supremacy by establishing a new
review to be called the <i>Quarterly</i>. Scott was finally estranged from the
<i>Edinburgh</i> by an article against the war of independence in Spain, and
the first number of the <i>Quarterly</i> appeared in February, 1809, with three
articles by him. It was published by John Murray, and edited by Gifford,
on much the same lines as the <i>Edinburgh</i>, but with a strong tory bias,
and with somewhat less of literary brilliancy. <i>Blackwood's Magazine</i>
followed a few years later, and the almost classical dualism of the
<i>Quarterly</i> and <i>Edinburgh</i> has long since been invaded by a multitude of
younger serials.</p>

<p>After the loss of its early monopoly of talent, the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>
still retained Jeffrey and Sydney Smith, and it was abundantly compensated
for the loss of Scott by the acquisition in 1825 of the fluent pen of
Macaulay. Born in 1800, the son of Zachary Macaulay, who like many other
philanthropists was on the tory side, he was early converted to the whig
party. He was well fitted to be a popular writer. His thought, never deep,
is always clear and vivid. None knew better how to seize a dramatic
incident or a picturesque simile, or to strike the weak points in his
adversary's armour. It has been said of him that he always chose to storm
a position by a cavalry charge, certainly the most imposing if not the
most effective method. Many of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span> his contributions to the <i>Edinburgh
Review</i> were afterwards republished as <i>Essays</i>, and already in those
earlier essays which appeared before 1837, we can see him assuming the
<i>r&ocirc;le</i> of the historical champion of the whigs. Widely read and with a
marvellous memory, he was generally accurate in his facts, but his
criticism of Gladstone applies with even greater force to himself: "There
is no want of light, but a great want of what Bacon would have called dry
light. Whatever Mr. Gladstone sees is refracted and distorted by a false
medium of passions and prejudices." The critic is sunk in the advocate,
and even a good cause is spoiled by a too obvious reluctance to admit
anything that comes from the other side. Perhaps his happiest, though far
from his greatest, work is to be found in the stirring ballads of <i>Ivry</i>
and the <i>Armada</i>, the precursors of the <i>Lays of Ancient Rome</i>. Deservedly
popular and full of patriotic fire, the class of literature to which they
belong renders questions of fairness or unfairness beside the point.</p>

<p>Another contributor to the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>, also famous as a historian,
was Thomas Carlyle. He was born in 1795 at Ecclefechan in Dumfriesshire,
and wrote for Brewster's <i>Encyclop&aelig;dia</i> and the <i>London Magazine</i> as well
as the <i>Edinburgh</i>. In 1826 he married Jane Welsh, and in 1828 he retired
from journalism to live humbly on her means. It was now that he began to
produce his best work. <i>Sartor Resartus</i> appeared in 1833-34, and the
<i>History of the French Revolution</i> in 1837. Even in the latter of these
works he is as much a preacher as a historian. Perhaps no other writer of
the age exercised a greater direct influence, and in his own country,
which seems specially amenable to the preacher's powers, his message has
been as effective in favour of broader views as the disruption of the
Church of Scotland in 1843 was in favour of the old orthodoxy. His
teaching has its roots in a German soil, but it bears the mark of his own
strong personality. His style, with a wilful ruggedness, displays the
German taste for the humour of an incongruous homeliness, where the
subject seems to call for a more dignified treatment. Perhaps this obvious
falseness of expression only relieves the weight of his stern earnestness
of purpose and makes us the more ready to join in his constant
denunciation of everything hollow and pretentious.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>LAMB.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_331" id="TOPIC_331"></a>Two new magazines appeared in or about 1817, <i>Blackwood's</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span> and the
<i>London</i>. Brilliant as the leading contributors to the former were, none
of them perhaps can claim a place in the front rank of English literature.
Of the contributors to the <i>London</i> Lamb is doubtless entitled to the
first place. Born in 1775, he was employed as a clerk in the East India
House from 1792 to 1825. He was a schoolfellow of Coleridge and
contributed to his earlier volume of poems It is, however, to the <i>Essays
of Elia</i> that he owes his fame. These appeared in the <i>London Magazine</i>
and were published in a collected form after his death in 1834. Few
authors that have been so much admired have exercised so little influence.
The reason for this is not far to seek. His style defies imitation, and he
would have been the last man to endeavour to win disciples to his
opinions. Another essayist who belongs to the same group of writers as
Coleridge and Lamb is Thomas de Quincey. He wrote both for <i>Blackwood's</i>
and for the <i>London Magazine</i>, in the latter of which appeared in 1821 his
best known work, the <i>Confessions of an English Opium Eater</i>. He excelled
in what was the dominant characteristic of English prose of this period,
in imagery, a quality which is conspicuous in the light fancy of
Coleridge's most famous poems, and which gives life to an author so
uniformly in dead earnest as Macaulay. Viewed historically, this taste for
imagery is the English side of the romantic movement, which in Germany
reacted against the conventional, not only in works of the imagination,
but in the heavier form of new philosophical systems. But these systems,
in spite of Coleridge, never became native in England. The growth of the
scientific spirit has made such thought and such language seem unreal in
serious literature, and prevents a later generation from imitating, though
not from admiring, the brilliance of the early essayists.</p>

<p>Hazlitt's genius was of a heavier type. As an essayist his work breathes
the spirit of an earlier age; but as a literary critic he is a leader, and
displays an inwardness in his appreciation that makes him in a sense the
model of the new age in which criticism has so largely supplanted
creation. It may be doubted, however, whether the abnormal growth of
criticism, as a distinct branch of English letters, has been a benefit on
the whole to our literature. Certainly it has tended to substitute the
elaborate study of other men's thoughts for original production, and,
after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span> all, the greatest critics have been those who, being more than
critics, have shown themselves capable of constructive efforts.</p>

<p>Two statesmen-novelists, Bulwer and Disraeli, are among the most
interesting literary characters of the end of this period. The former of
these, like his French contemporary Victor Hugo, had a remarkable gift for
expressing each successive phase of popular taste. He resembled Disraeli
in acquiring a pre-eminent position in letters in early youth, which was
followed by political success at a later age. Though neither rose to
cabinet rank before a time of life which must with literary men rank as
"middle age," Bulwer had, in the midst of an active parliamentary career,
been an active novelist, in fact the most popular novelist of his day.
Disraeli, on the other hand, only entered parliament after the close of
the period dealt with in this volume, and it is to this period, while he
was still unknown to politics, that the greater part of his literary work
belongs. One other resemblance between these writers is perhaps not less
interesting to the historian than to the critic. Both made use of
literature to establish for themselves a reputation as "men of the world,"
an ambition which Bulwer's social position might easily justify, and
without which it would be impossible to understand the career of Disraeli.
Born in 1803 and 1804 respectively, both made their mark with their first
novels in 1827, Bulwer with <i>Falkland</i>, Disraeli with a work in which his
own career has been supposed to be foreshadowed&mdash;<i>Vivian Grey</i>. One other
great novelist had appeared before the close of the reign of William IV.
In 1836 Charles Dickens produced <i>Sketches by Boz</i> and began the <i>Pickwick
Papers</i>, but he belongs properly to the next reign.</p>

<p>Among the historians of this period the first place undoubtedly belongs to
Henry Hallam. Born in 1788, he produced his <i>View of the State of Europe
during the Middle Ages</i> in 1818, and his <i>Constitutional History of
England</i> in 1827, while his <i>Introduction to the Literature of Europe</i>
began to appear in 1837. Like Macaulay he represents the whig attitude
towards politics, but does so less consciously and less emphatically than
his younger contemporary. There is a sense in which no constitutional
historian has adopted so strictly legal an attitude. It is not merely that
his interest centres on the legal side of the constitution, but,
lawyer-like, he judges every con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span>stitutional issue of the past in the
light of the legal system which the law of his own day presupposes for the
date in question. No one can deny the validity of this principle in a
court of justice, but no one gifted either with historical imagination or
with historical sympathy could wish to introduce it into a historical
work. Yet the very narrowness of his outlook made it easier for him to
adopt the impartiality of a judge; his criterion of justice is too
definite to allow him to indulge in special pleading or to twist facts to
suit his theories; and the student still turns to Hallam with a sense of
security which he does not feel in reading Macaulay or Carlyle.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>FINE ART.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_332" id="TOPIC_332"></a>The fine arts cannot be said to have flourished in England during the
period of the great war, and architecture was certainly at a low ebb, but
several eminent names belong to this period. Sir Thomas Lawrence was by
far the foremost English portrait painter, and fitly represents the
elegance of the regency, while Raeburn enjoyed an equal reputation in
Scotland. Turner, however, was painting in his earlier manner and showing
originality even in his imitations of old masters. Constable, too, was
producing some of those quiet English landscapes which, though little
appreciated at the time, have since made him famous. Two other English
landscape painters, Callcott and the elder Crome, were also in their
prime, and Wilkie executed several of his best known masterpieces at this
time. David Cox and Prout did not earn celebrity till a little later. The
Water-Colour Society was founded in 1804. Soon afterwards Flaxman was in
the zenith of his fame, being elected professor of sculpture by the Royal
Academy in 1810, and Chantrey was beginning to desert portrait painting
for statuary.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_333" id="TOPIC_333"></a>Science, especially in its practical applications, made greater strides
than art in the early years of the nineteenth century. It was now that
Jenner's memorable discovery of vaccination, dating from 1796, was
generally adopted by the medical profession. In 1802 his claim to priority
was recognised by a parliamentary committee, with the result that &pound;10,000
were then voted to him, and a further grant of &pound;20,000 was made in 1807,
when vaccination was established at the Small-pox Hospital. In 1814,
George Stephenson, after many preliminary experiments, made a successful
trial of his first locomotive engine. In 1812, Bell's steamboat, the
<i>Comet</i> made its first<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span> voyage on the Clyde, and the development of steam
navigation proceeded more rapidly than that of steam locomotion by land.
Sir Humphry Davy began his researches in 1800, and took part in that year,
with Count Rumford and Sir Joseph Banks, in founding the Royal
Institution. His invention of the safety lamp was not matured until 1815.</p>

<p>But if the principal contributions of England to physical science in the
early years of the century were mainly in the direction of practical
application, her contributions to pure theory under the regency and in the
reign of William IV. were no less distinguished. Sir John Herschel,
following in the footsteps of his father, began in 1824 his observations
on double stars and his researches upon the parallax of fixed stars, while
Sir George Airy published in 1826 his mathematical treatises on lunar and
planetary theory. In Michael Faraday England possessed at once an eminent
chemist and the greatest electrician of the age. The discovery of benzine
and the liquefaction of numerous gases were followed by an investigation
of electric currents, and in 1831 by the crowning discovery of induction.
Not less valuable perhaps than these discoveries of his own were the
fertile suggestions which he left to others. William Smith, sometimes
called the father of modern English geology, vigorously followed up the
work of James Hutton by publishing in 1815 his great map of English
<i>strata</i> as identified by fossils. Charles Lyell's <i>Principles of Geology</i>
marks a great advance in geological science. In this book, which appeared
in 1833, the author advanced the view, now universally accepted, that the
great geological changes of the past are not to be explained as
catastrophes, followed by successive creations, but as the product of the
continuous play of forces still at work. This theory contained all that
was vital in the doctrine of evolution; but it was only at a later date,
when the doctrine had become the property of zoologists as well as
geologists and had been popularised by Darwin, that it came to exercise an
influence over non-scientific thought.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>UNIVERSITY REFORM.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_334" id="TOPIC_334"></a>A review of the literary and scientific progress of this period would be
incomplete without some notice of progress in higher education. The
universities of Oxford and Cambridge with their numerous colleges had in
the eighteenth century lapsed into that lethargic condition which seemed
to be the common<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span> fate of all corporations. They had to a certain extent
ceased to be seats of learning. At Oxford the limitations imposed upon
colleges by statute or custom in elections to fellowships and scholarships
ensured the mediocrity of the teachers and gave the preference to
mediocrities among the students. Where emoluments were not so restricted
they were generally awarded by interest rather than by merit; and it was
even the case that a scholarship at Winchester, carrying with it the right
to a fellowship at New College, was often promised to an infant only a few
days old. The Oxford examination system had not been reformed since the
time of Laud, and the degree examinations had degenerated into mere
formalities until the university in 1800 adopted a new examination
statute, mainly under the influence of Dr. Eveleigh, provost of Oriel. The
new statute, which came into operation in 1802, granted honours to the
better students of each year. The number of candidates to whom honours
were granted, at first very small, rapidly increased till in 1837 about
130 received honours in a single year. The attention which the examination
system received from the hebdomadal board, so often accused of
sluggishness, is proved by the frequent changes in the regulations, which
among other things differentiated between honours in "Liter&aelig; Humaniores"
and in mathematics in 1807, and separated the honours and pass
examinations in 1830. The same desire to encourage meritorious students
showed itself in the institution of competitive examinations for
fellowships, in which Oriel led the way. It was followed in 1817 by
Balliol, which in 1827 threw open its scholarships as well. It was not,
however, till the reign of Queen Victoria that the college statutes as a
whole were so modified as to make open competition possible in more than a
very few instances.</p>

<p>Cambridge suffered less than Oxford from restrictions as to the choice of
fellows. In fact the majority of the fellowships, more especially of those
which carried with them a vote in the government of the colleges, were, so
far as the statutes went, open to all comers. Though the course of study
was still nominally regulated by statutes dating from the Tudor period,
which it would often have been ludicrous to enforce, an effective stimulus
was given to mathematical studies by the mathematical tripos, which had
existed from the middle of the eighteenth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span> century, and to which in 1824 a
classical tripos was added. The ground covered by these honour
examinations was certainly narrower than that which lay within the scope
of the corresponding examinations at Oxford, but at both places the
studies of most undergraduates were still directed more by the judgment of
their tutors than by the regulations of the university.</p>

<p>These two universities were, however, subject to two limitations, which
prevented them from providing a higher education for all aspiring
students. The expense of living at Oxford and Cambridge, and the close
connexion of both universities with the Church of England, rendered them
difficult of access to many. These limitations were emphasised by the fact
that Scotland possessed five universities which were the opposite of the
English in both respects, and not a few English students could always be
found at the Scottish seats of learning. The reform ministry made a
serious effort to remove or alleviate the grievances of dissenters. Among
other reforms mooted was the abolition of theological tests for
matriculation and graduation. In 1834 a bill, which proposed to effect
this change, but which left intact such tests as existed for fellowships
and professorships, passed its second reading in the commons by a majority
of 321 against 174, and its third reading by 164 against 75. It was,
however, thrown out on the second reading in the lords by 187 votes
against 85. Though in this particular case the demands of the dissenters
were moderate, they were themselves opposed to other measures introduced
for their benefit, and the question of tests at Oxford and Cambridge was
not unnaturally allowed to rest for another twenty years.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>UNIVERSITY OF LONDON.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_335" id="TOPIC_335"></a>It was only in the reign of George IV. that anything was done to provide a
university education for those who were unable to proceed to the ancient
seats of learning. But the movement, once started, progressed rapidly. The
oldest of the university colleges, as they are now called, is St. David's
College, Lampeter, which was founded in 1822, mainly through the exertions
of Dr. Thomas Burgess, Bishop of St. David's, who was supported by many
others among the Welsh clergy. The college was opened in 1827, but at
first it had no power of conferring degrees, and contented itself with the
education of candidates for holy orders. A more important movement was
initiated in 1825. In a public letter written by the poet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</a></span> Campbell to
Brougham, the project of founding a university of London, which should be
free from denominational restrictions, was advocated. The scheme was
warmly embraced by many whose names are found associated with other
movements of the times. Among them were Hume, Grote, Zachary Macaulay,
Dudley, and Russell. A large proportion of the promoters of the new
university had been educated at Scottish universities, and had therefore a
clear idea of the type of university which they might establish, and the
movement, although started primarily in the interests of dissenters,
received the support of many who still valued the connexion of the
universities with the Church. The "London University," as it was called,
was opened in 1828, when classes were formed in arts, law, and medicine,
but not in divinity. It was technically a joint-stock company, and the
attempt of the shareholders to obtain a charter of incorporation was
successfully resisted by the universities of Oxford and Cambridge.</p>

<p>Meanwhile some of the original supporters of the movement, regarding the
non-religious character of the new university with suspicion, had decided
to transfer their support to a new college, where the doctrine and worship
of the Church of England should be recognised. The Duke of Wellington took
a lively interest in this movement, and King George IV.'s patronage gave
the new institution the name of "King's College". There seemed every
reason to expect that the foundation would be on a munificent scale, when
Wellington's acceptance of catholic emancipation offended many of the
subscribers so deeply that they immediately withdrew from the undertaking,
and the college was in consequence left almost entirely without endowment.
State recognition, however, was given it from the first. It was
incorporated in 1829, and opened in 1831. In 1835 the demand of "London
University" for a charter received the support of the house of commons,
and Lord Melbourne's government decided to propose a compromise, by which
the so-called "London University" was to be converted into University
College, and an examining body was to be created under the title of the
University of London, while the work of teaching was to be performed by
University College, King's College, and other colleges, which might from
time to time be named by the crown. These terms were accepted by the
existing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span> "university," and charters were given to the new university and
to University College, London, in 1836. It was thus left open to students
or their parents to select either a denominational or an undenominational
college, according to their preference.</p>

<p>Meanwhile another university had been founded in the north of England. The
dean and chapter of Durham had determined to set aside a part of their
emoluments for the foundation of a university, and the bishop had
undertaken to assist them by attaching prebendal stalls in the cathedral
to some of the professorships. An act of parliament was obtained in 1832,
authorising the establishment of the new university, which was opened in
October, 1833, and was incorporated by a royal charter on June 1, 1837. As
an ecclesiastical foundation, the university of Durham was of course in
the closest connexion with the established Church.</p>

<p>None of these new foundations could compare in respect of endowments with
the old universities of Oxford and Cambridge, yet it was not altogether
without reason that the founders of University College, London, hoped to
give as good an education at a greatly reduced cost. It must be remembered
that only a small fraction of the endowments of the old universities and
their colleges was at this time applied to strictly educational purposes,
and, until they should either be reformed or become more sensible of their
opportunities, there was a fair field for an energetic rival.</p>

<p>The beginning of the nineteenth century witnessed a marvellous expansion
of manufacturing industry, not so much caused by new discoveries as by the
energetic application of those made at the end of the last century, by the
growth of the factory-system, and, above all, by the monopoly of
English-made goods during the great war. The innovation of
machine-spinning and weaving by power-looms had an instant effect in
stimulating and cheapening the production of cottons, but that of
woollens, cramped by heavy duties on the raw material, languished for some
time longer under traditional methods of handspinning. When
stocking-frames and other forms of machinery penetrated at last into its
strongholds in the West Riding of Yorkshire and in the midland counties,
the demand for "hands" was inevitably reduced, and "frame-breaking"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span> riots
ensued, which lasted for several years. From this period dates the
industrial revolution which gradually abolished domestic industries,
separated mill-owners and mill-hands into almost hostile classes,
undermined the system of apprenticeship, and brought about a large
migration of manufactures from centres with abundant water-power to
centres in close proximity to coal-fields.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>PROGRESS OF AGRICULTURE.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_336" id="TOPIC_336"></a>The progress of British agriculture during the period under review was
almost as marked as that of British manufactures. Under the impulse of war
prices, and of the improvements adopted at the end of the eighteenth
century, the home-production of corn almost kept pace with the growing
consumption, and between 1801 and 1815 little more than 500,000 quarters
of imported corn were required annually to feed the population. No doubt,
when the price of bread might rise to famine-point, the consumption of it
fell to a minimum per head; still, the rural population continued to
multiply, though not so rapidly as the urban population, and neither could
have been maintained without a constant increase in the production of the
soil. This result was due to a progressive extension of enclosure and
drainage, as well as to wise innovations in the practice of agriculture.
Not the least important of such innovations was the destruction of useless
fences and straggling hedge-rows, the multitude and irregular outlines of
which had long been a picturesque but wasteful feature of old-fashioned
English farming. This was the age, too, in which many a small farm
vanished by consolidation, and many an ancient pasture was recklessly
broken up, some of which, though once more covered with green sward, have
never recovered their original fertility. Happily, the use of crushed
bones for manure was introduced in 1800, and the efforts of the national
board of agriculture, aided by the discoveries of Sir Humphry Davy,
brought about a far more general application of chemical science to
agriculture, partly compensating for the exhaustion of the soil under
successive wheat crops. Not less remarkable was the effect of mechanical
science in the development of new agricultural implements, which, however,
retained a comparatively rude form of construction. The Highland Society
of Scotland took a leading part in encouraging these gradual experiments
in tillage, as well as in the breeding of sheep and cattle, with a
special<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</a></span> regard to early maturity. Had the farmers of Great Britain during
the great war possessed no more skill than their grandfathers, it would
have been impossible for the soil of this island to have so nearly
supported its inhabitants before the ports were freely thrown open.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_337" id="TOPIC_337"></a>The great triumphs of engineering in the fifteen years before the battle
of Waterloo were mainly achieved in facilitating locomotion, and are
specially associated with the name of Telford. It was he who, following in
the footsteps of Brindley and Smeaton, constructed the Ellesmere and
Caledonian Canals; he far eclipsed the fame of General Wade by opening out
roads and bridges in the highlands, and first adopted sound principles of
road-making both in England and Wales, afterwards to be applied with
marvellous success by Macadam. It is some proof of the impulse given to
land-travelling by such improvements that 1,355 public stage-coaches were
assessed in 1812, and that a rate of speed little short of ten miles an
hour was attained by the lighter vehicles. But Telford's labours were not
confined to roads or bridges; they extended also to harbours and to
canals, which continued to be the great arteries of heavy traffic until
the development of railways. The new power destined to supersede both
coaches and barges was first recognised practically when Bell's little
steam vessel the <i>Comet</i> was navigated down the Clyde in 1812, to be
followed not many years later by a steamship capable of crossing the
Atlantic Ocean. In a few years steam packets were numerous, but it was not
till well into the reign of Victoria that steam navigation was used in the
royal navy.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>RAILWAYS.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_338" id="TOPIC_338"></a>The most conspicuous improvement in the social and economic condition of
the country between 1815 and 1837 is undoubtedly the invention of the
steam locomotive engine. A few steam locomotives had been invented before
the former date, but they had met with little success and were as yet more
costly than horse traction. It was only in or about the year 1815 that
George Stephenson, enginewright in Killingworth colliery, succeeded in
inventing a locomotive engine which was cheaper than horse-power. The
value of railways was by this time better understood. Short railways
worked by horses were common in the neighbourhood of collieries, and a few
existed elsewhere. In 1821 Edward Pease obtained parliamentary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span> powers to
construct a railway between Stockton and Darlington. A visit to
Killingworth persuaded him to make use of steam-power. In 1823 an act
authorising the use of steam on the proposed railway was carried, and in
1825 the railway was opened. In 1826 an act was passed for the
construction of a railway between Liverpool and Manchester. Stephenson was
employed as engineer to make the line, and his success as a road-making
engineer proved equal to his brilliance as a mechanical inventor.</p>

<p>In 1829 the line was completed. The directors were at first strongly
opposed to the use of steam-locomotion, but were induced by Stephenson,
before finally rejecting the idea, to offer a reward of &pound;500 for the best
locomotive that could be made. Of four engines which were entered for the
competition, Stephenson's <i>Rocket</i> was the only one that would move, and
it proved able to travel at the rate of thirty-five miles an hour. The
opening of the railway in 1830, and the fatal accident to Mr. Huskisson
which attended it, have been noticed already. The accident did more to
attract attention to the power of the locomotive than to discredit it. The
opposition to railways was not, however, at an end. A proposal for a
railway between London and Birmingham was carried through parliament, only
after a struggle of some years' duration, but the construction of the line
was at length authorised in 1833. The English railway system now developed
with great rapidity, and by the end of the reign of William IV. lines had
been authorised which would when complete form a system, joining London
with Dover, Southampton, and Bristol, and both London and Bristol with
Birmingham, whence lines were to run to the most important places in
Yorkshire and Lancashire, and on to Darlington. Numerous small lines
served other portions of the country, partly in connexion with these, but
more often independently.</p>

<p>Among the more conspicuous metropolitan improvements of this age may be
mentioned the introduction of gas and the incipient construction of new
bridges over the Thames, in which the engineer Rennie took a leading part.
Before the end of the eighteenth century the workshops of Boulton and Watt
had been lit by gas, and Soho was illuminated by it to celebrate the peace
of Amiens. By 1807 it was used in Golden Lane, and by 1809, if not
earlier, it had reached Pall Mall, but it scarcely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</a></span> became general in
London until somewhat later. At the beginning of the century the
metropolis possessed but three bridges, old London bridge and the old
bridges at Blackfriars and Westminster. The first stone of the Strand
Bridge (afterwards to be called Waterloo Bridge) was laid on October 11,
1811, and Southwark Bridge was commenced in 1814, but these bridges were
not completed till 1817 and 1819 respectively. The existing London Bridge,
designed by Rennie, but built after his death, was completed in 1831. In
1812, the architect Nash was employed in laying out the Regent's Park, and
in 1813 an act was passed for the construction of Regent Street, as a
grand line of communication between it and Carlton House, the residence of
the regent.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_339" id="TOPIC_339"></a>The work of geographical discovery had been well commenced before the end
of the eighteenth century, and was inevitably checked during the great
war. The wonderful voyages of Cook had revealed Australia and New Zealand;
Flinders had carried on the survey of the Australian coast; Vancouver had
explored the great island which bears his name with the adjacent shores;
Rennell had produced his great map of India; Bruce had published his
celebrated travels in Abyssinia; and an association had been formed to
dispel the darkness that hung over the whole interior of Africa. Among its
first emissaries was Mungo Park, who afterwards was employed by the
British government, and died in the course of his second expedition in
1805-6. The idea of Arctic discovery was revived early in the nineteenth
century, and was no longer confined to commercial aims, such as the
opening of a north-east or north-west passage, but was rather directed to
scientific objects, not without the hope of reaching the North Pole
itself. Meanwhile, the ordnance survey of Great Britain itself was in full
progress, and that of British India was commenced in 1802, while the
hydrographical department of the admiralty, established in 1795, was
organising the system of marine-surveying which has since yielded such
valuable fruits.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_340" id="TOPIC_340"></a>The progress of philanthropy, based on religious sentiment was very marked
during the later years of the war. The institution of Sunday schools
between 1780 and 1790 had awakened a new sense of duty towards children in
the community, and the growing use of child-labour, keeping pace with the
constant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</a></span> increase of machinery, forced upon the public the necessity of
legislative restrictions, which have been noticed in an earlier chapter.
Banks of savings, the forerunners of savings banks under parliamentary
regulation, had been suggested by Jeremy Bentham, and one at least was
instituted in 1802. The idea of penitentiaries, for the reformation as
well as for the punishment of criminals, had originated with the great
philanthropist, John Howard. It was adopted and popularised by Jeremy
Bentham, and might have been further developed but for the introduction of
transportation, which promised the well-conducted convict the prospect of
a new life in a new country. Meanwhile, prison reform became a favourite
study of benevolent theorists in an age when the criminal law was still a
relic of barbarism, when highway robbery was rife in the neighbourhood of
London, when sanitation was hardly in its infancy, when pauperism was
fostered by the poor law, and when the working classes in towns were
huddled together, without legal check or moral scruple, in undrained
courts and underground cellars. So capricious and shortsighted is the
public conscience in its treatment of social evils.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>CANADA.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_341" id="TOPIC_341"></a>At the opening of the nineteenth century the colonial empire of Great
Britain was in a transitional state. The secession of thirteen American
colonies had not only robbed the mother country of its proudest
inheritance, but had also shattered the old colonial system of commercial
monopoly for the supposed benefit of British interests. Its immediate
effect was to annul the navigation act as affecting American trade, which
became free to all the world, and by which Great Britain itself profited
largely. Canada at once gained a new importance, and a new sense of
nationality, which Pitt recognised by dividing it into two provinces, and
giving each a considerable measure of independence, both political and
commercial. It was troubled by the presence of a conquered race of white
colonists side by side with new colonists of English blood, who were,
however, united in their resistance to the revolted colonies in the war of
1812-14. After the war a steady stream of immigration poured into Canada.
In 1816 the population was estimated at 450,000; between 1819 and 1829
Canada received 126,000 immigrants from England, and during the next ten
years 320,000. The result was that the French element ceased to be
preponderant,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</a></span> except in Lower Canada. The French Canadians felt that they
did not enjoy their share of the confidence of government; the home
government, ready enough to grant any favour that home opinion would
permit, was trammelled by a public opinion, which suspected all who were
of a French origin of a desire to restore the supremacy of the Roman
Catholic religion and to assert political independence. A vacillating
policy was the result, which only increased suspicions, and led in the
first year of the reign of Victoria to a civil war.</p>

<p>In the Mauritius and the West Indies the one event of importance in this
period is the abolition of slavery. It was found impossible to obtain from
free negroes as much work as had been obtained from slaves, and their
place had to be supplied by Indian coolies in the Mauritius, and by
Chinese in Jamaica. At the same time the West Indies had begun to suffer
from the competition of the United States.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_342" id="TOPIC_342"></a>The colony of the Cape of Good Hope was still peopled almost entirely by
blacks or by the descendants of Dutch settlers, known as <i>boers</i>, or
peasants. Four thousand British colonists went out in 1820 to Algoa Bay,
but these were a mere handful compared with the Dutch. Unfortunately the
government adopted a line of policy which produced great irritation in the
Dutch population. They were granted no self-government, and in 1826
English judicial forms were introduced, and English was declared the sole
official language. The reform administration made matters worse by
defending the blacks against the boers. In 1834 it set free the slaves,
offering &pound;1,200,000, payable in London, very little of which ever reached
the boers, as compensation for slaves valued at &pound;3,000,000. A Kaffir war
in 1834 had led to the conquest of Kaffraria, but in 1835 the home
government restored the independence of the Kaffirs, and appointed a
lieutenant-governor to defend their rights. After this the boers
considered their position intolerable, and in 1835 began their first
"trek" into the country now known as Natal.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>AUSTRALIA.</i></div>

<p><a name="TOPIC_343" id="TOPIC_343"></a>Meanwhile, the great discoveries of Captain Cook, and the first settlement
of New South Wales, brought within view a possible extension of our
colonial dominion, which might go far to compensate for its losses on the
North American continent. Governor Phillip had been sent out by Pitt to
Botany Bay in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</a></span> 1787-88, but it was many years before the earliest of
Australian colonies outgrew the character of a penal refuge for English
convicts. The first convict establishments were at Sydney and Norfolk
Island, but another settlement was founded on Van Diemen's Land in 1805,
and in 1807, after this island had been circumnavigated by Flinders and
Bass, it became the headquarters of that convict system, whose horrors are
not yet forgotten. Between 1810 and 1822 the resources of New South Wales
were vastly developed by the energetic policy of Governor Macquarie. While
his efforts to utilise convict labour, and to educate convicts into free
men, may have retarded the influx of genuine colonists, he prepared the
way for settlement by constructing roads, promoting exploration, and
raising public buildings, so that when he returned home the population of
New South Wales had increased fourfold, and its settled territory in a
much greater proportion. This territory comprised all English settlements
on the east coast, and included large tracts of what is now known as
Queensland, which did not become a separate colony until 1859.</p>

<p><a name="TOPIC_344" id="TOPIC_344"></a>The early history of Australia, it has been said, is chiefly a tale of
convict settlements, bush-ranging, and expeditions of discovery. There is
much truth in this saying, but the real basis of Australian prosperity was
the introduction of sheep-farming on a large scale, after the merino-breed
had been imported and acclimatised by Macarthur at the beginning of the
century. Long before the region stretching northward from the later Port
Phillip grew into the colony of Victoria, sheep-owners were spreading over
the vast pastures of the interior, though many years elapsed before the
explorer Sturt opened out the great provinces further westward.</p>

<p>The development of Australia made rapid progress during the generation
following the great war. Though Australia itself and Van Diemen's Land,
now called Tasmania, were still in the main convict settlements, free
settlers had been arriving at Sydney for some time, and in 1817 they began
to arrive in moderate numbers in Van Diemen's Land. In 1825 that island
had sufficiently progressed to be recognised as a separate colony. The
attempt to found a colony in western Australia in 1829 was, on the other
hand, an almost complete failure. But in 1824 a new centre of colonisation
in New South Wales<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</a></span> had been established at Port Phillip. Meanwhile a
sharp cleavage of parties had arisen. The convicts and poorer colonists
were opposed to the large sheep-owners, who were endeavouring to form an
aristocracy. Governor Macquarie favoured the convicts, and Governor
Darling (1825-31) the sheep-owners. In 1823 a legislative council,
consisting of seven officials, had been instituted; in 1828 it was
developed into one of fifteen members, chosen entirely from among the
wealthiest colonists.</p>

<p>Gibbon Wakefield's <i>Letter from Sydney</i>, published in 1829, marks an epoch
in the history of Australian colonisation. In this work he proposed that
the land should be sold in small lots at a fairly high price to settlers,
and that the proceeds of the sales should be used to pay the passage of
emigrants going out as labourers. This idea had hardly been published when
it was adopted by the home government, and five shillings an acre was
fixed as the minimum price of land. The number of emigrants increased
rapidly, but the new system threatened ruin to the owners of sheep-runs.
Unable to pay the stipulated price, they only moved further into the
interior and occupied fresh land without seeking government permission, an
unlicensed occupation which has left its mark upon the language in the
word "squatter". At last in 1837 a compromise was arranged, by which the
squatters were to pay a small rent for their runs, the crown retaining the
freehold with the right to sell it to others at some future date. In 1834
the British government sanctioned the formation of a new colony, that of
South Australia. It was to be settled from the outset on the Wakefield
system, and no convicts were ever sent to it. The first lots were sold as
high as twelve shillings an acre, and in 1836 a company of emigrants went
out and founded Adelaide.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</a></span></p>

<p>(1) General histories of England for the period 1801-1837: <span class="smcap">Massey</span>,
<i>History of England during the Reign of George the Third</i> (4 vols., 2nd
ed., 1865), closes with the treaty of Amiens in 1802, and therefore barely
touches this period. There is still room for a general history of England
on an adequate scale between 1802 and 1815. After that date we have
<span class="smcap">Harriet Martineau</span>, <i>History of England during the Thirty Years' Peace</i>
(1816-1846, 2 vols., 1849, 1850). This was begun by Charles Knight, the
publisher, who brought it down to 1819. From 1820 onwards it is Miss
Martineau's own work. It is too nearly contemporary to depend on any
authorities except such as were published at the time, and it represents
in the main the popular view of public events and public men held by
liberals at the time. Sir <span class="smcap">Spencer Walpole's</span> <i>History of England from the
Conclusion of the Great War in 1815</i> (6 vols., revised ed., 1890), a work
of high quality and thoroughly trustworthy, full of references to the best
published authorities, sympathises with the whigs and more liberal tories.
Reference is sometimes made in this volume to <span class="smcap">Goldwin Smith</span>, <i>The United
Kingdom, a Political History</i> (2 vols., 1899), but the work is too slight
to be regarded as an authority. Sir <span class="smcap">T. E. May's</span> (Lord Farnborough)
<i>Constitutional History of England from 1760 to 1860</i> (3 vols., 10th ed.,
1891) is also useful.</p>

<p>(2) The <i>Annual Register</i> is probably the most useful authority for this
period. In addition to more general information, it contains a very full
report of the more important parliamentary debates and the text of the
principal public treaties and of numerous other state papers. The
narrative is not often coloured by the political partisanship of the
writer, but allowance must be made for the strong tory bias of the volumes
dealing with the reign of William IV. The <i>Parliamentary History</i> closes
in 1803, at which date Cobbett's <i>Parlia<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</a></span>mentary Debates</i> had begun to
appear. After 1812 Cobbett ceased to superintend the work and his name was
dropped, and in 1813 and afterwards the title-page acknowledged that the
work was "published under the superintendence of T. C. Hansard," who had
also been the publisher of Cobbett's series and of the <i>Parliamentary
History</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>MEMOIRS AND CORRESPONDENCE.</i></div>

<p>(3) Political and other memoirs and printed correspondence. The following
have been noticed among the authorities for volume x.: <span class="smcap">Pellew</span>, <i>Life and
Correspondence of H. Addington, Viscount Sidmouth</i> (3 vols., 1847), very
full wherever Sidmouth was directly concerned, written with a strong bias
in favour of the subject of the biography. Lord <span class="smcap">Stanhope</span>, <i>Life of Pitt</i>
(4 vols., 3rd ed., 1867). The appendix to the last volume contains Pitt's
correspondence with the king in the years 1804-1806. Lord <span class="smcap">Rosebery</span>, <i>Pitt</i>
(Twelve English Statesmen Series, 1891), brilliant but not always sound.
Lord <span class="smcap">John</span> (Earl) <span class="smcap">Russell</span>, <i>Memorials and Correspondence of C. J. Fox</i> (4
vols., 1853-1854), and <i>Life and Times of C. J. Fox, 1859-1866</i>. <i>Memoirs
of the Courts and Cabinets of George III.</i> (4 vols., 1853-1855; 1801 falls
in vol. iii.), continued in <i>Memoirs of the Court of England during the
Regency</i> (2 vols., 1856), <i>Memoirs of the Court of George IV.</i> (2 vols.,
1859), and <i>Memoirs of the Courts and Cabinets of William IV. and
Victoria</i> (2 vols., 1861; 1837 is reached in vol. i.); these volumes,
edited by the Duke of Buckingham, contain the correspondence of the
Grenville family. The first series alone, which contains many important
letters of Lord Grenville, is of first-rate importance. The editing is
often inaccurate. <i>Diaries and Correspondence of the First Earl of
Malmesbury</i> (4 vols., 1844), edited by the third earl (vol. iv. extends
from February, 1801, to July, 1809), authoritative and useful, especially
for the crisis of 1807. <i>Correspondence of Marquis Cornwallis</i> (3 vols.,
1859), edited by C. Ross, valuable for the negotiations at Amiens and for
Cornwallis's brief second governor-generalship of India. The notes are
full of useful biographical material concerning the persons mentioned in
the correspondence. <i>Diaries and Correspondence of George Rose</i> (2 vols.,
1860), edited by L. V. Harcourt. <i>The Diary and Correspondence of Charles
Abbot, Lord Colchester</i>, edited by his son (3 vols., 1861, extending from
1795 to 1829), with interesting notices of Perceval, and generally useful
from 1802-1817, when Abbot was Speaker. Lord <span class="smcap">Holland</span>, <i>Memoirs of the Whig
Party</i> (2 vols., 1852), edited by his son, Lord Holland. These memoirs do
not extend beyond the year 1807. Volume ii., which covers the period
during which Holland was a member of the Grenville cabinet, is of special
importance. His memory is not always accurate, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</a></span> he writes with a whig
bias which makes him a harsh judge of George III. Holland's <i>Further
Memoirs of the Whig Party, 1807-1821</i>, edited by Lord Stavordale, the
present Lord Ilchester (1905), interesting, and, like the earlier volumes,
full of personal detail, but of less value, since Holland was not in
office again till 1830.</p>

<p>Similar in character to the above, but only of importance after 1801 are
the following: <i>Life of Perceval</i> (2 vols., 1874), by his grandson, Sir
Spencer Walpole, written largely from the Perceval papers, especially
valuable for the ministerial crisis of 1809. The <i>Memoirs and
Correspondence of Viscount Castlereagh</i> (12 vols., 1850-1853), edited by
his brother the third Marquis of Londonderry, consisting mainly of
military and diplomatic correspondence. Sir <span class="smcap">Archibald Alison</span>, <i>Lives of
Lord Castlereagh and Sir Charles Stewart, the Second and Third Marquesses
of Londonderry</i> (3 vols., 1861), much more political than biographical;
valuable and appreciative, but not rich in documents. <i>The Dispatches of
the Duke of Wellington during his various Campaigns in India, Denmark
[etc.], from 1799 to 1818</i> (12 vols., 1834-1838), compiled by
Lieut.-Colonel <span class="smcap">Gurwood</span> (really extending to 1815 only); <i>Supplementary
Despatches and Memoranda of the Duke of Wellington</i> (15 vols., 1858-1872),
edited by his son, the second Duke of Wellington, extending from 1797 to
1818; <i>Despatches, Correspondence, and Memoranda of the Duke of
Wellington</i> (8 vols., 1867-1880), by the same editor, extending from 1819
to 1832. The second and third of these series contain not only the duke's
despatches, but the vast mass of political correspondence which passed
through his hands. In spite of the great size of the collection, very
little that can be considered trivial is included. It is our most
important authority for all foreign relations between 1815 and 1827, and
between 1828 and 1830. Sir <span class="smcap">Herbert Maxwell</span>, <i>The Life of Wellington</i> (2
vols., 1899). <span class="smcap">Horace Twiss</span>, <i>Life of Eldon</i> (3 vols., 1844). <span class="smcap">C. Phipps</span>,
<i>Memoir of R. Plumer Ward</i> (2 vols., 1850), containing important political
correspondence from 1801 onward, and Ward's diary from 1809 to 1820. Ward
held numerous minor offices in the government and was on terms of intimacy
with Perceval and Mulgrave. <span class="smcap">Moore</span>, <i>Life of Sheridan</i> (2 vols., 1826),
valuable for the crisis of 1811. <i>The Greville Memoirs; a Journal of the
Reigns of King George IV. and King William IV.</i> (3 vols.), edited by Henry
Reeve. References are to the first edition, 1874. New edition, also
including 1837-1860 in 8 vols. (1888). Greville was clerk to the privy
council from 1821 to 1859, and as such possessed exceptional opportunities
for making himself acquainted with secret political transactions and with
the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</a></span> personal qualities of successive statesmen. <i>The Creevey Papers</i> (2
vols., 1903), edited by Sir Herbert Maxwell, not of first-rate historical
importance, full of gossip and scandal. Creevey was a whig member of
parliament, 1802-1818, 1820-1828 and 1831-1832, and treasurer of the
ordnance, 1830-1834. <span class="smcap">Stapleton</span>, <i>The Political Life of George Canning
(from September 1822 to August 1827)</i> (3 vols., 1831), very full and
valuable, especially for foreign relations; strikingly deficient in
documents and dates. <i>George Canning and His Times</i> (1859), by the same
author, largely written from memory and therefore untrustworthy. <span class="smcap">Yonge</span>,
<i>Life and Administration of Lord Liverpool</i> (3 vols., 1868). <i>Memoirs of
Sir Robert Peel</i> (2 vols., 1856-1857), prepared by Peel himself, and
dealing with the Roman Catholic question, the administration of 1834-1835,
and the repeal of the corn laws. The memoirs, which are of the highest
importance, consist mainly of correspondence and are studiously fair.
<span class="smcap">Parker</span>, <i>Sir Robert Peel</i> (3 vols., 1891-1899), a large collection of
Peel's correspondence with a brief connecting narrative by the editor, of
great value even for the periods covered by the <i>Memoirs</i>. <i>The
Correspondence of King William IV. and Earl Grey, from November 1830 to
June 1832</i> (2 vols., 1867), edited by Henry, Earl Grey, valuable for the
history of the reform. <i>The Melbourne Papers</i> (1889), edited by Sanders,
throw light on Melbourne's relations with William IV. and with Brougham.
<span class="smcap">Torrens</span>, <i>Memoirs of Melbourne</i> (2 vols., 1878), polemical, and sadly
deficient in documents. Lord <span class="smcap">Hatherton</span>, <i>Memoir and Correspondence
relating to June and July, 1834</i> (published 1872), edited by H. Reeve, on
events connected with the fall of Grey's ministry. <i>The Croker Papers</i> (3
vols., 1884), edited by L. J. Jennings. Croker was secretary to the
admiralty from 1809 to 1830. The papers, which are very full from 1809
onwards, consist of correspondence and selections from Croker's journals
and correspondence. <span class="smcap">L. Horner</span>, <i>Memoir of Francis Horner</i> (1843). <span class="smcap">E.
Herries</span>, <i>Public Life of J. C. Herries</i> (1880), a defence of Herries
against the sneers of whig writers. Lord <span class="smcap">Dudley</span>, <i>Letters to the Bishop of
Llandaff</i> (Copleston), (1840), and <i>Letters to Ivy</i> (1905, edited by
Romilly), interesting and often vivacious, but not of first-rate
importance. Sir <span class="smcap">Henry Bulwer</span> (Lord Dalling), <i>Life of Palmerston</i> (2
vols., 1870), extending to 1840. The first chapter of a third volume,
edited by Evelyn Ashley (1874) makes good a few omissions belonging to
this period. The work consists mainly of correspondence and extracts from
Palmerston's journal. <i>Memoirs of Baron Stockmar</i> (2 vols., 1872-1873), by
his son Baron E. von Stockmar, edited by F. Max M&uuml;ller. Stockmar was a
confi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</a></span>dential agent of Leopold, King of the Belgians. The memoirs contain
a narrative by William IV. of the political history of his reign to 1835,
including the circumstances of Melbourne's resignation in 1834. <span class="smcap">Campbell</span>,
<i>Lives of the Chancellors</i> (8 vols., 1848-1869). The last volume contains
excellent sketches of Lyndhurst and Brougham, based largely on personal
knowledge. <i>Correspondence of Princess Lieven and Earl Grey, 1824-1834</i>,
edited by G. le Strange (1890). <i>Letters of Dorothea, Princess Lieven
during Her Residence in London, 1812-1834</i>, edited by L. G. Robinson
(1902). <i>Letters of Harriet, Countess Granville, 1810-1845</i> (2 vols.,
1894).</p>

<p>(4) Miscellaneous books. Sir <span class="smcap">G. C. Lewis</span>, <i>Administrations of Great
Britain (1783-1830)</i>, edited by Sir E. Head, 1864, has been mentioned
among the authorities for volume x. It is a valuable history of the inner
political life of England, but suffers from a strong whig bias. <span class="smcap">Lecky</span>,
<i>History of Ireland in the Eighteenth Century</i> (5 vols., 1892), though
nominally closing at the union, throws light on Irish history at the
beginning of the nineteenth century. <span class="smcap">A. V. Dicey</span>, <i>Lectures on the
Relation between Law and Public Opinion in England during the Nineteenth
Century</i> (1905), is very suggestive. <span class="smcap">Hal&eacute;vy</span>, <i>La formation du radicalisme
philosophique</i> (3 vols., 1901-1904), and Sir <span class="smcap">L. Stephen</span>, <i>The English
Utilitarians</i>, vols. i., ii. (1900), are valuable for the history of the
radical party. <span class="smcap">C. Creighton</span>, <i>History of Epidemics in Britain</i> (2 vols.,
1894), contains an excellent account of the cholera epidemic.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>ON THE GREAT WAR.</i></div>

<p>(5) Books dealing with the great war are numerous. The following have been
already noticed among the authorities for volume x.: Dr. <span class="smcap">Holland Rose</span>,
<i>Life of Napoleon I.</i> (2 vols., 1904), our most trustworthy guide for the
career of the French emperor. The book has gained not a little from its
author's independent researches at the British Foreign Office. Captain
<span class="smcap">Mahan</span>, <i>Influence of Sea Power upon the French Revolution and Empire</i> (2
vols., 1893), and <i>Life of Nelson</i> (2 vols., 1897), valuable for their
general view of the naval warfare and commercial policy of the period.
<span class="smcap">James</span>, <i>Naval History of Great Britain, 1793-1820</i> (6 vols., ed. 1826;
vols. iii.-vi. extend from 1801-1820), very full and accurate, largely
used in this volume for the American war. Sir <span class="smcap">John Laughton</span>, <i>Nelson</i>
(English Men of Action Series, 1895), and articles in the <i>Dictionary of
National Biography</i>.</p>

<p>To these must be added <span class="smcap">Alison's</span> <i>History of Europe from the Commencement
of the French Revolution in 1789 to the Restoration of the Bourbons in
1815</i> (20 vols., 1847, 1848), an uncritical but still a standard work. The
reaction against Alison is probably due in large measure to political
causes. In addition to the European history which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</a></span> gives its title to the
book, it contains a narrative of the American war of 1812-1814. The
classical though far from trustworthy narrative on the French side is
<span class="smcap">Thiers</span>, <i>Histoire du Consulat et de l'Empire</i> (21 vols., 1845-1869),
translated into English by Campbell and Stebbing (12 vols., 1893-1894).
See also <span class="smcap">Lanfrey's</span> incomplete <i>History of Napoleon I.</i>, English
translation (4 vols., 1871-1879), bitterly anti-Napoleonic. The
negotiations precedent to the outbreak of war in 1803 are to be found in
Mr. <span class="smcap">O. Browning's</span> <i>England and Napoleon in 1803</i>, containing despatches of
Whitworth and others, published in 1887, and in <span class="smcap">P. Coquelle</span>, <i>Napoleon and
England, 1803-1813</i>, translated by <span class="smcap">G. D. Knox</span> (1904), based on the reports
of Andr&eacute;ossy, the French ambassador at London. Sir <span class="smcap">H. Bunbury's</span> <i>Narrative
of Certain Passages, etc.</i> (1853) is of the highest value for the war in
the Mediterranean. The <i>Times</i> of September 16, 19, 22, 26, 28, 30, and
October 19, 1905, contains an excellent series of articles on Nelson's
tactics at Trafalgar. For the Moscow campaign, the Marquis <span class="smcap">de Chambray's</span>
<i>Histoire de l'Exp&eacute;dition de Russie</i> (3 vols., 1839) is perhaps the most
reliable of contemporary narratives. There is a good account of the
campaign in the Rev. <span class="smcap">H. B. George's</span> <i>Napoleon's Invasion of Russia</i>
(1899). For the Peninsular war, <span class="smcap">W. Napier's</span> <i>History of the War in the
Peninsula and in the South of France</i> (6 vols.; vols. i.-iii., ed.
1835-1840; iv.-vi., 1834-1840) is of the highest literary as well as
historical value. <span class="smcap">C. Oman's</span> <i>History of the Peninsular War</i> (in progress,
vols. i., ii., 1902-1903, extending at present to September, 1809) makes
good use of Spanish sources of information. The <i>Wellington Dispatches</i>
have been noticed already in section 3. The <i>Diary of Sir John Moore</i>,
edited by Sir J. F. Maurice (2 vols., 1904), is of value for the campaign
of 1808-1809. For Waterloo, in addition to Maxwell's <i>Life of Wellington</i>,
and Rose's <i>Life of Napoleon I.</i>, Chesney's <i>Waterloo Lectures</i>, 1868; <span class="smcap">W.
O'Connor Morris</span>, <i>The Campaign of 1815</i> (1900), and <span class="smcap">J. C. Ropes</span>, <i>The
Campaign of Waterloo</i>, may be studied with profit. Morris's work must,
however, be discounted for his extravagant admiration of Napoleon's genius
and his faith in the Grouchy legend. For the disputes with the United
States and war of 1812-1814, see chapters in the <i>Cambridge Modern
History</i> (vol. vii., 1903); <span class="smcap">Bourinot</span>, <i>Canada</i> (Story of the Nations),
(1897); <span class="smcap">J. Schouler</span>, <i>History of the United States of America under the
Constitution</i> (6 vols., 1880-1889); and <span class="smcap">Mahan</span>, <i>Sea Power in Its Relations
to the War of 1812</i> (2 vols., 1905).</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS.</i></div>

<p>(6) For European politics and foreign relations generally, in addition to
some of the books mentioned in the last section, we have <span class="smcap">C.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</a></span> A. Fyffe's</span>
<i>History of Modern Europe, 1792-1878</i> (ed. 1895), a very readable book,
which includes the results of some original study, and <span class="smcap">Seignobos</span>,
<i>Political History of Contemporary Europe</i>, English translation (2 vols.,
1901), an useful but not always accurate book. The great French work,
<i>Histoire g&eacute;n&eacute;rale du IV<span style="vertical-align:super">e</span> Si&egrave;cle &agrave; nos jours</i> (vols. ix., x., 1897-1898),
by numerous authors, edited by MM. Lavisse and Rambaud, is naturally of
varying merit; the chapters on France and Russia are the best, and there
is a very full bibliography at the close of each chapter. The <i>Cambridge
Modern History</i>, vol. ix., <i>Napoleon</i> (1906), is a similar compilation by
English writers. <span class="smcap">Alfred Stern's</span> <i>Geschichte Europas seit den Vertr&auml;gen von
1815</i> (3 vols., 1894-1901, to be continued to 1871) is perhaps the best
general history of the period following the great war. <i>The Memoirs of
Prince Metternich</i> (5 vols., English translation, 1881-1882, edited by
Prince Richard Metternich, extending to 1835) contain much that is
valuable for diplomatic history. For French history see <span class="smcap">Duvergier de
Hauranne</span>, <i>Histoire du gouvernement parlementaire en France</i> (1814-1848,
10 vols., 1857-1872), which, in spite of the title, does not extend beyond
1830. For the Greek revolt, vols. vi. and vii. of <span class="smcap">G. Finlay's</span> <i>History of
Greece</i> (7 vols., ed. 1877) are important. American policy is treated by
<span class="smcap">J. W. Foster</span>, <i>A Century of American Diplomacy</i> (1901). Sir <span class="smcap">Edward
Hertslet's</span> <i>Map of Europe by Treaty</i> (4 vols., 1875-1891), while
professedly confined to the treaties dealing with boundaries, contains the
majority of those of general historical interest. It covers the period
1815-1891. <span class="smcap">Le Comte de Garden</span>, <i>Histoire g&eacute;n&eacute;rale des trait&eacute;s de paix</i> (14
vols., 1848-1888, vols. vi.-xv., extending to 1814), and <span class="smcap">F. de Martens</span>,
<i>Recueil des trait&eacute;s et conventions, conclus par la Russie</i> (tomes xi.,
xii. (Angleterre), 1895-1898), contain the principal treaties belonging to
the period. The <i>Castlereagh</i> and <i>Wellington</i> <i>Despatches</i> have been
noticed under section 3.</p>

<p>(7) For Indian history: <span class="smcap">James Mill</span> and <span class="smcap">Wilson</span>, <i>History of British India</i>
(10 vols., 1858), vols. vi.-ix., noticed as an authority for volume x.,
ends in 1835; Sir <span class="smcap">Alfred C. Lyall's</span> <i>Rise and Expansion of the British
Dominion in India</i> (1894) contains a brief and masterly sketch of the
subject. See also <i>A Selection from the Despatches, Treaties and Other
Papers of the Marquess Wellesley</i> (1877), well edited by S. J. Owen; the
first two series of the <i>Wellington Dispatches</i>, noticed under section 3;
and the vast mass of information collected in Sir <span class="smcap">W. W. Hunter's</span> <i>Imperial
Gazetteer of India</i> (14 vols., 1885-1887).</p>

<p>(8) For social and economic history: Dr. <span class="smcap">W. Cunningham's</span> <i>The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</a></span> Growth of
English Industry and Commerce in Modern Times</i>, vol. iii., <i>Laissez Faire</i>
(1903), extending from 1776 to 1850, is now the standard work. Reference
has also been made to <span class="smcap">G. R. Porter</span>, <i>Progress of the Nation</i> (1847), a
work abounding more in statistics than in narrative, and to Sir <span class="smcap">George
Nicholls</span>, <i>History of the English Poor Law</i> (2 vols., 1854). Nicholls took
an active interest in social and economic questions from 1816 till his
death in 1857. He probably understood the working of the poor-law better
than any other man of that date, and the poor-law legislation of 1834 and
1838 was largely founded on his suggestions. He was one of the poor-law
commissioners of 1834, and was permanent secretary to the poor-law board
from 1847 to 1851. Sir <span class="smcap">G. C. Lewis</span>, <i>The Government of Dependencies</i>
(1891), edited by C. P. Lucas, and <span class="smcap">Lucas</span>, <i>Historical Geography of the
British Colonies</i>, vols. i.-v. (1888-1901), are of value. For literary
history, <span class="smcap">Saintsbury's</span> <i>History of Nineteenth Century Literature,
1780-1895</i>, (1896), is an excellent guide. For educational progress at
Oxford University reference may be made to the <i>Report of H.M.'s
Commissioners appointed to inquire into the State, etc., of the University
and Colleges of Oxford</i> (1852), which contains a good historical summary.
The report of the similar commission appointed for Cambridge hardly
touches the progress of studies, and is therefore of less value to the
historical student.</p>
